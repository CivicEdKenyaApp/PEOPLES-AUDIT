The pattern has now extended into the digital sphere. Kenya’s corruption story is not just about missing billions, complex budgets, or failed institutions. It is about citizens struggling to live with dignity in a country where the state has chosen waste and violence over rights and service. The politi- cal class thrives in opulence financed by the same public that endures hunger, over-taxation, and collapsing public systems. On October 15, 2025, President William Ruto signed the Comput- er Misuse and Cybercrimes (Amendment) Act, 2024, a law that expands state powers to monitor, block, and take down online content deemed a threat to “national security” or “public order.”10 Civil society groups and digital rights advocates argue that the changes to the law are a blatant attack on freedom of expression, and seek to give the government unchecked discretion to restrict digital platforms without judicial oversight. The result is a chill- ing effect on dissent, where criticism of governance is increasing- ly treated as subversion rather than civic engagement.11 The promise of the 2010 Constitution and the guarantee of rights and social justice have become a dream deferred. 1.1 Hunger in the midst of plenty Despite Kenya having extraordinary untapped agricultural wealth, particularly in the fertile highlands and medium-to-high der the weight of allegations of embezzlement and mismanage- theft of their future.

        "title": "A duel between the Constitution and corruption Economic recovery in Kenya cannot be separated from the health of the country’s democracy. A functioning economy de- mands more than growth indicators; it requires a constitutional order that safeguards accountability, upholds separation of powers, and protects citizens’ rights. Without constitutionalism, impunity becomes the currency of governance. Institutions that should enforce transparency and integrity are often captured, meaning that private interests manipulate public authority for personal enrichment. This process diverts resources away from essential services, diminishes public trust, and entrenches in- equality. Kenya’s recurring fiscal crises — reflected in more than 21 International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank support programs — illustrate how mismanagement that is induced by corruption repeatedly destabilises the economy and undermines reform.79 Chapter 3.1: Mimicking the Constitution The 2010 Constitution of Kenya was conceived as a national cove- nant against historical patterns of centralised plunder and exec- utive dominance. It aimed to institutionalise integrity, transpar- ency, and accountability in governance by creating a system that dispersed power, and public oversight. Fifteen years later, howev- er, these constitutional ideals have not reached the ground. Fiscal indiscipline, political corruption, and institutional subversion have corroded the democratic foundations that the Constitution sought to secure.80 Kenya’s political economy operates through what some scholars term as “constitutional mimicry”, a system where institutions ex- ist in form but do not function as expected. Statutory procedures, regulatory bodies, and oversight mechanisms are formally main- tained but serve extractive rather than protective purposes. This pseudo-constitutional order enables legality without legitimacy, allowing elites to convert public office into private enterprise. The governance crisis is therefore not primarily one of admin- istrative capacity but of political incentives: the system rewards impunity, punishes integrity, and transforms public institutions into vehicles for rent-seeking.81 3.1.1 Roots of economic capture in bad governance and impunity Kenya’s economic governance remains trapped in a cycle where fiscal management serves political control rather than pub- lic service. The 2010 Constitution envisioned public finance as a moral covenant: that every shilling raised and spent would reflect fairness, prudence and accountability. Fifteen years lat- er, that covenant has been broken more often than it has been honoured. Budgeting and debt management have become in- struments through which power is accumulated, accountabil- ity is deflected, and public wealth is privately appropriated. The struggle for economic recovery is therefore impossible to separate from the pushback against impunity. Economic deci- sions are political acts, and their consequences reach deeply into citizens’ daily lives -- from the cost of food to the quality of health- care, education, and local infrastructure. This section traces how economic capture has taken root within the core institutions of government, and how it continues to erode constitutional democ- racy. 3.1.2 The anatomy of impunity in economic management has only expanded the scope for discretion and patronage. Kenya has produced an average of two supplementary bud- Between FY2013/14 and FY2025/26, Kenya’s national bud- gets per year.85 However, FY 2024/25 was an exception due to get more than doubled -- rising from KSh 1.6 trillion to ap- Debt servicing now consumes more than half of government rev- the rejection of the Finance Bill, 2024: this financial year had proximately KSh 4.2 trillion.82 Yet the quality of public ser- enue.

The Okoa Uchumi Campaign is a citizen and civil society ini- tiative that has, since 2019, advocated the prudent use of public resources. This was born out of a realisation that by 2019, Kenya was on a precarious path towards a debt trap. Over the years, we have engaged various actors -- including National Treasury offi- cials, the Council of Governors, Members of Parliament, presiden- tial candidates in elections, including President William Ruto, and Kenyan taxpayers. We have realised that the state of Kenya’s economy and public finance is not a product of the lack of insti- tutions, laws or even skilled people; it comes from failure of the political class to pledge fidelity to the Constitution of Kenya and put the people first through all public finance processes. Over the years, we have reiterated that Kenya does not have a rev- enue problem; it has an expenditure problem, which is well illus- trated by state opulence, wastage, and, at times, outright theft of public resources. As such, we know that the story of Kenya’s econ- omy is not written in spreadsheets or policy briefs. It is etched in the struggles of citizens crushed by debt, rising taxes, stolen re- sources, and a political system that has betrayed its people. This People’s Audit of economic misgovernance is our act of resistance and truth-telling in the face of state capture and impunity. We write at a moment when international institutions such as the deep history of structural and endemic systems and a political rising from KSh2.4 trillion in 2014 to KSh12 .05 trillion in 2025, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are scruti- system that extracts, excludes, and exploits its people by raising while the value of goods and services over the same period has nising Kenya’s governance through diagnostic and public finance taxes and debts, and diminishing the public services accessible grown by under 5 per cent.5 Much of the debt is from commercial reviews. These exercises may be necessary, but they are incom- to citizens. It is a story of how all factors of production are either loans, international lenders who pool to lend money to the gov- plete.

        "DECEMBER 8, 2025 4 OKOA UCHUMI CAMPAIGN CONVENED BY TISA Claiming people’s sovereignty in public spending Office of the Citizen is the logical evolution of years’-long efforts of the Okoa Uchumi Campaign, a citizen-led civil society initiative founded in 2019 to champion transparency and accountability in fiscal governance in Kenya. The Okoa Uchumi Campaign is a citizen and civil society ini- tiative that has, since 2019, advocated the prudent use of public resources. This was born out of a realisation that by 2019, Kenya was on a precarious path towards a debt trap. Over the years, we have engaged various actors -- including National Treasury offi- cials, the Council of Governors, Members of Parliament, presiden- tial candidates in elections, including President William Ruto, and Kenyan taxpayers. We have realised that the state of Kenya’s economy and public finance is not a product of the lack of insti- tutions, laws or even skilled people; it comes from failure of the political class to pledge fidelity to the Constitution of Kenya and put the people first through all public finance processes. Over the years, we have reiterated that Kenya does not have a rev- enue problem; it has an expenditure problem, which is well illus- trated by state opulence, wastage, and, at times, outright theft of public resources. As such, we know that the story of Kenya’s econ- omy is not written in spreadsheets or policy briefs. It is etched in the struggles of citizens crushed by debt, rising taxes, stolen re- sources, and a political system that has betrayed its people. This People’s Audit of economic misgovernance is our act of resistance and truth-telling in the face of state capture and impunity. We write at a moment when international institutions such as the deep history of structural and endemic systems and a political rising from KSh2.4 trillion in 2014 to KSh12 .05 trillion in 2025, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are scruti- system that extracts, excludes, and exploits its people by raising while the value of goods and services over the same period has nising Kenya’s governance through diagnostic and public finance taxes and debts, and diminishing the public services accessible grown by under 5 per cent.5 Much of the debt is from commercial reviews.

The pattern has now extended into the digital sphere. Kenya’s corruption story is not just about missing billions, complex budgets, or failed institutions. It is about citizens struggling to live with dignity in a country where the state has chosen waste and violence over rights and service. The politi- cal class thrives in opulence financed by the same public that endures hunger, over-taxation, and collapsing public systems. On October 15, 2025, President William Ruto signed the Comput- er Misuse and Cybercrimes (Amendment) Act, 2024, a law that expands state powers to monitor, block, and take down online content deemed a threat to “national security” or “public order.”10 Civil society groups and digital rights advocates argue that the changes to the law are a blatant attack on freedom of expression, and seek to give the government unchecked discretion to restrict digital platforms without judicial oversight. The result is a chill- ing effect on dissent, where criticism of governance is increasing- ly treated as subversion rather than civic engagement.11 The promise of the 2010 Constitution and the guarantee of rights and social justice have become a dream deferred. 1.1 Hunger in the midst of plenty Despite Kenya having extraordinary untapped agricultural wealth, particularly in the fertile highlands and medium-to-high der the weight of allegations of embezzlement and mismanage- theft of their future.

A functioning economy de- mands more than growth indicators; it requires a constitutional order that safeguards accountability, upholds separation of powers, and protects citizens’ rights. Without constitutionalism, impunity becomes the currency of governance. Institutions that should enforce transparency and integrity are often captured, meaning that private interests manipulate public authority for personal enrichment. This process diverts resources away from essential services, diminishes public trust, and entrenches in- equality. Kenya’s recurring fiscal crises — reflected in more than 21 International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank support programs — illustrate how mismanagement that is induced by corruption repeatedly destabilises the economy and undermines reform.79 Chapter 3.1: Mimicking the Constitution The 2010 Constitution of Kenya was conceived as a national cove- nant against historical patterns of centralised plunder and exec- utive dominance. It aimed to institutionalise integrity, transpar- ency, and accountability in governance by creating a system that dispersed power, and public oversight. Fifteen years later, howev- er, these constitutional ideals have not reached the ground. Fiscal indiscipline, political corruption, and institutional subversion have corroded the democratic foundations that the Constitution sought to secure.80 Kenya’s political economy operates through what some scholars term as “constitutional mimicry”, a system where institutions ex- ist in form but do not function as expected. Statutory procedures, regulatory bodies, and oversight mechanisms are formally main- tained but serve extractive rather than protective purposes. This pseudo-constitutional order enables legality without legitimacy, allowing elites to convert public office into private enterprise. The governance crisis is therefore not primarily one of admin- istrative capacity but of political incentives: the system rewards impunity, punishes integrity, and transforms public institutions into vehicles for rent-seeking.81 3.1.1 Roots of economic capture in bad governance and impunity Kenya’s economic governance remains trapped in a cycle where fiscal management serves political control rather than pub- lic service. The 2010 Constitution envisioned public finance as a moral covenant: that every shilling raised and spent would reflect fairness, prudence and accountability. Fifteen years lat- er, that covenant has been broken more often than it has been honoured. Budgeting and debt management have become in- struments through which power is accumulated, accountabil- ity is deflected, and public wealth is privately appropriated. The struggle for economic recovery is therefore impossible to separate from the pushback against impunity.

It asks whether the state exists to protect its citizens or to preserve elite privilege. The prioritization of debt repayment and recurrent expenditure over investment in education, health, and social protection exposes a hierarchy of values that places creditors above citizens and expedience above justice. 245Fiscal policy is therefore not merely an instrument of management but a moral statement about who matters in a republic. The deliberate diversion of public funds from essential services to patronage networks has transformed poverty into a policy outcome rather than a policy failure. Citizens are compelled to finance their own disenfranchisement through regressive taxa- tion and unproductive borrowing. This dynamic represents both fiscal injustice and moral harm. As public finance scholars have observed, democratic budgeting must embody distributive jus- tice, which is the equitable allocation of resources that affirms human dignity246. The fiscal state cannot claim legitimacy while denying citizens the basic conditions necessary for that dignity. 238 Office of the Auditor-General (Kenya), Consolidated Report on the In Kenya, this moral dimension has been displaced by what can National Government for the Year Ended 30 June 2024; and be termed as fiscal nihilism; a governing mindset that treats ac- Consolidated Report on County Governments for the Year Ended 30 countability as a threat and transparency as an inconvenience.

It asks whether the state exists to protect its citizens or to preserve elite privilege. The prioritization of debt repayment and recurrent expenditure over investment in education, health, and social protection exposes a hierarchy of values that places creditors above citizens and expedience above justice. 245Fiscal policy is therefore not merely an instrument of management but a moral statement about who matters in a republic. The deliberate diversion of public funds from essential services to patronage networks has transformed poverty into a policy outcome rather than a policy failure. Citizens are compelled to finance their own disenfranchisement through regressive taxa- tion and unproductive borrowing. This dynamic represents both fiscal injustice and moral harm. As public finance scholars have observed, democratic budgeting must embody distributive jus- tice, which is the equitable allocation of resources that affirms human dignity246. The fiscal state cannot claim legitimacy while denying citizens the basic conditions necessary for that dignity. 238 Office of the Auditor-General (Kenya), Consolidated Report on the In Kenya, this moral dimension has been displaced by what can National Government for the Year Ended 30 June 2024; and be termed as fiscal nihilism; a governing mindset that treats ac- Consolidated Report on County Governments for the Year Ended 30 countability as a threat and transparency as an inconvenience.

      "text": "DECEMBER 8, 2025 4 OKOA UCHUMI CAMPAIGN CONVENED BY TISA Claiming people s sovereignty in public spending Office of the Citizen is the logical evolution of years -long efforts of the Okoa Uchumi Campaign, a citizen-led civil society initiative founded in 2019 to champion transparency and accountability in fiscal governance in Kenya. The Okoa Uchumi Campaign is a citizen and civil society ini- tiative that has, since 2019, advocated the prudent use of public resources. This was born out of a realisation that by 2019, Kenya was on a precarious path towards a debt trap. Over the years, we have engaged various actors -- including National Treasury offi- cials, the Council of Governors, Members of Parliament, presiden- tial candidates in elections, including President William Ruto, and Kenyan taxpayers. We have realised that the state of Kenya s economy and public finance is not a product of the lack of insti- tutions, laws or even skilled people; it comes from failure of the political class to pledge fidelity to the Constitution of Kenya and put the people first through all public finance processes. Over the years, we have reiterated that Kenya does not have a rev- enue problem; it has an expenditure problem, which is well illus- trated by state opulence, wastage, and, at times, outright theft of public resources. As such, we know that the story of Kenya s econ- omy is not written in spreadsheets or policy briefs. It is etched in the struggles of citizens crushed by debt, rising taxes, stolen re- sources, and a political system that has betrayed its people. This People s Audit of economic misgovernance is our act of resistance and truth-telling in the face of state capture and impunity. We write at a moment when international institutions such as the deep history of structural and endemic systems and a political rising from KSh2.4 trillion in 2014 to KSh12 .05 trillion in 2025, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are scruti- system that extracts, excludes, and exploits its people by raising while the value of goods and services over the same period has nising Kenya s governance through diagnostic and public finance taxes and debts, and diminishing the public services accessible grown by under 5 per cent.5 Much of the debt is from commercial reviews.

For citizens, these fiscal dynamics translate into higher taxes, delayed service delivery and reduced development spending.

      "text": "DECEMBER 8, 2025 OKOA UCHUMI CAMPAIGN CONVENED BY TISA 11 Chapter 3: A duel between the Constitution and corruption Economic recovery in Kenya cannot be separated from the health of the country s democracy. A functioning economy de- mands more than growth indicators; it requires a constitutional order that safeguards accountability, upholds separation of powers, and protects citizens rights. Without constitutionalism, impunity becomes the currency of governance. Institutions that should enforce transparency and integrity are often captured, meaning that private interests manipulate public authority for personal enrichment. This process diverts resources away from essential services, diminishes public trust, and entrenches in- equality. Kenya s recurring fiscal crises reflected in more than 21 International Monetary Fund IMF and World Bank support programs illustrate how mismanagement that is induced by corruption repeatedly destabilises the economy and undermines reform.79 Chapter 3.1: Mimicking the Constitution The 2010 Constitution of Kenya was conceived as a national cove- nant against historical patterns of centralised plunder and exec- utive dominance. It aimed to institutionalise integrity, transpar- ency, and accountability in governance by creating a system that dispersed power, and public oversight. Fifteen years later, howev- er, these constitutional ideals have not reached the ground. Fiscal indiscipline, political corruption, and institutional subversion have corroded the democratic foundations that the Constitution sought to secure.80 Kenya s political economy operates through what some scholars term as constitutional mimicry , a system where institutions ex- ist in form but do not function as expected. Statutory procedures, regulatory bodies, and oversight mechanisms are formally main- tained but serve extractive rather than protective purposes. This pseudo-constitutional order enables legality without legitimacy, allowing elites to convert public office into private enterprise. The governance crisis is therefore not primarily one of admin- istrative capacity but of political incentives: the system rewards impunity, punishes integrity, and transforms public institutions into vehicles for rent-seeking.81 3.1.1 Roots of economic capture in bad governance and impunity Kenya s economic governance remains trapped in a cycle where fiscal management serves political control rather than pub- lic service. The 2010 Constitution envisioned public finance as a moral covenant: that every shilling raised and spent would reflect fairness, prudence and accountability. Fifteen years lat- er, that covenant has been broken more often than it has been honoured. Budgeting and debt management have become in- struments through which power is accumulated, accountabil- ity is deflected, and public wealth is privately appropriated. The struggle for economic recovery is therefore impossible to separate from the pushback against impunity. Economic deci- sions are political acts, and their consequences reach deeply into citizens daily lives -- from the cost of food to the quality of health- care, education, and local infrastructure. This section traces how economic capture has taken root within the core institutions of government, and how it continues to erode constitutional democ- racy. 3.1.2 The anatomy of impunity in economic management has only expanded the scope for discretion and patronage. Kenya has produced an average of two supplementary bud- Between FY2013 14 and FY2025 26, Kenya s national bud- gets per year.85 However, FY 2024 25 was an exception due to get more than doubled -- rising from KSh 1.6 trillion to ap- Debt servicing now consumes more than half of government rev- the rejection of the Finance Bill, 2024: this financial year had proximately KSh 4.2 trillion.82 Yet the quality of public ser- enue.

It asks whether the state exists to protect its citizens or to preserve elite privilege. The prioritization of debt repayment and recurrent expenditure over investment in education, health, and social protection exposes a hierarchy of values that places creditors above citizens and expedience above justice. 245Fiscal policy is therefore not merely an instrument of management but a moral statement about who matters in a republic. The deliberate diversion of public funds from essential services to patronage networks has transformed poverty into a policy outcome rather than a policy failure. Citizens are compelled to finance their own disenfranchisement through regressive taxa- tion and unproductive borrowing. This dynamic represents both fiscal injustice and moral harm. As public finance scholars have observed, democratic budgeting must embody distributive jus- tice, which is the equitable allocation of resources that affirms human dignity246. The fiscal state cannot claim legitimacy while denying citizens the basic conditions necessary for that dignity. 238 Office of the Auditor-General Kenya , Consolidated Report on the In Kenya, this moral dimension has been displaced by what can National Government for the Year Ended 30 June 2024; and be termed as fiscal nihilism; a governing mindset that treats ac- Consolidated Report on County Governments for the Year Ended 30 countability as a threat and transparency as an inconvenience.

When fiscal systems are open, when institutions act independently, and when citizens participate meaningfully, governance becomes both ethical and effective.

      "text": "DECEMBER 8, 2025 4 OKOA UCHUMI CAMPAIGN CONVENED BY TISA Claiming people s sovereignty in public spending Office of the Citizen is the logical evolution of years -long efforts of the Okoa Uchumi Campaign, a citizen-led civil society initiative founded in 2019 to champion transparency and accountability in fiscal governance in Kenya. The Okoa Uchumi Campaign is a citizen and civil society ini- tiative that has, since 2019, advocated the prudent use of public resources. This was born out of a realisation that by 2019, Kenya was on a precarious path towards a debt trap. Over the years, we have engaged various actors -- including National Treasury offi- cials, the Council of Governors, Members of Parliament, presiden- tial candidates in elections, including President William Ruto, and Kenyan taxpayers. We have realised that the state of Kenya s economy and public finance is not a product of the lack of insti- tutions, laws or even skilled people; it comes from failure of the political class to pledge fidelity to the Constitution of Kenya and put the people first through all public finance processes. Over the years, we have reiterated that Kenya does not have a rev- enue problem; it has an expenditure problem, which is well illus- trated by state opulence, wastage, and, at times, outright theft of public resources. As such, we know that the story of Kenya s econ- omy is not written in spreadsheets or policy briefs.

      "text": "DECEMBER 8, 2025 OKOA UCHUMI CAMPAIGN CONVENED BY TISA 5 Chapter 1: How the forgotten half lives Each morning, Kenyans wake up to the same bleak arithmetic: hunger in their homes, joblessness among their youth, hospitals without medicine, schools without teachers, and a government that treats dissent as treason. The pattern has now extended into the digital sphere. Kenya s corruption story is not just about missing billions, complex budgets, or failed institutions. It is about citizens struggling to live with dignity in a country where the state has chosen waste and violence over rights and service. The politi- cal class thrives in opulence financed by the same public that endures hunger, over-taxation, and collapsing public systems. On October 15, 2025, President William Ruto signed the Comput- er Misuse and Cybercrimes Amendment Act, 2024, a law that expands state powers to monitor, block, and take down online content deemed a threat to national security or public order. 10 Civil society groups and digital rights advocates argue that the changes to the law are a blatant attack on freedom of expression, and seek to give the government unchecked discretion to restrict digital platforms without judicial oversight. The result is a chill- ing effect on dissent, where criticism of governance is increasing- ly treated as subversion rather than civic engagement.11 The promise of the 2010 Constitution and the guarantee of rights and social justice have become a dream deferred. 1.1 Hunger in the midst of plenty Despite Kenya having extraordinary untapped agricultural wealth, particularly in the fertile highlands and medium-to-high der the weight of allegations of embezzlement and mismanage- theft of their future.

      "text": "DECEMBER 8, 2025 OKOA UCHUMI CAMPAIGN CONVENED BY TISA 11 Chapter 3: A duel between the Constitution and corruption Economic recovery in Kenya cannot be separated from the health of the country s democracy. A functioning economy de- mands more than growth indicators; it requires a constitutional order that safeguards accountability, upholds separation of powers, and protects citizens rights. Without constitutionalism, impunity becomes the currency of governance. Institutions that should enforce transparency and integrity are often captured, meaning that private interests manipulate public authority for personal enrichment. This process diverts resources away from essential services, diminishes public trust, and entrenches in- equality. Kenya s recurring fiscal crises reflected in more than 21 International Monetary Fund IMF and World Bank support programs illustrate how mismanagement that is induced by corruption repeatedly destabilises the economy and undermines reform.79 Chapter 3.1: Mimicking the Constitution The 2010 Constitution of Kenya was conceived as a national cove- nant against historical patterns of centralised plunder and exec- utive dominance. It aimed to institutionalise integrity, transpar- ency, and accountability in governance by creating a system that dispersed power, and public oversight. Fifteen years later, howev- er, these constitutional ideals have not reached the ground. Fiscal indiscipline, political corruption, and institutional subversion have corroded the democratic foundations that the Constitution sought to secure.80 Kenya s political economy operates through what some scholars term as constitutional mimicry , a system where institutions ex- ist in form but do not function as expected. Statutory procedures, regulatory bodies, and oversight mechanisms are formally main- tained but serve extractive rather than protective purposes. This pseudo-constitutional order enables legality without legitimacy, allowing elites to convert public office into private enterprise. The governance crisis is therefore not primarily one of admin- istrative capacity but of political incentives: the system rewards impunity, punishes integrity, and transforms public institutions into vehicles for rent-seeking.81 3.1.1 Roots of economic capture in bad governance and impunity Kenya s economic governance remains trapped in a cycle where fiscal management serves political control rather than pub- lic service. The 2010 Constitution envisioned public finance as a moral covenant: that every shilling raised and spent would reflect fairness, prudence and accountability. Fifteen years lat- er, that covenant has been broken more often than it has been honoured. Budgeting and debt management have become in- struments through which power is accumulated, accountabil- ity is deflected, and public wealth is privately appropriated. The struggle for economic recovery is therefore impossible to separate from the pushback against impunity. Economic deci- sions are political acts, and their consequences reach deeply into citizens daily lives -- from the cost of food to the quality of health- care, education, and local infrastructure.

It asks whether the state exists to protect its citizens or to preserve elite privilege. The prioritization of debt repayment and recurrent expenditure over investment in education, health, and social protection exposes a hierarchy of values that places creditors above citizens and expedience above justice. 245Fiscal policy is therefore not merely an instrument of management but a moral statement about who matters in a republic. The deliberate diversion of public funds from essential services to patronage networks has transformed poverty into a policy outcome rather than a policy failure. Citizens are compelled to finance their own disenfranchisement through regressive taxa- tion and unproductive borrowing. This dynamic represents both fiscal injustice and moral harm. As public finance scholars have observed, democratic budgeting must embody distributive jus- tice, which is the equitable allocation of resources that affirms human dignity246. The fiscal state cannot claim legitimacy while denying citizens the basic conditions necessary for that dignity. 238 Office of the Auditor-General Kenya , Consolidated Report on the In Kenya, this moral dimension has been displaced by what can National Government for the Year Ended 30 June 2024; and be termed as fiscal nihilism; a governing mindset that treats ac- Consolidated Report on County Governments for the Year Ended 30 countability as a threat and transparency as an inconvenience.
