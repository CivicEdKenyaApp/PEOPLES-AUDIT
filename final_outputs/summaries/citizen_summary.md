# Understanding Kenya's Economic Problems: A Citizen's Guide

## The Big Picture

Kenya is facing a serious economic crisis caused by corruption and bad governance. 
Here's what every Kenyan needs to know:

### 1. The Debt Crisis
Kenya's debt has grown from **KSh 2.4 trillion in 2014** to **KSh 12.05 trillion in 2025**. 
That's **5 times more debt** in just 11 years.

**What this means for you:**
- Every Kenyan – including newborn babies – owes **KSh 240,000** in public debt
- For every 100 shillings the government collects in taxes, **56 shillings** goes to paying debt
- Only **15 shillings** is left for building schools, hospitals, and roads

### 2. The Corruption Problem
Kenya loses about **KSh 800 billion every year** to corruption. That's like losing **one-third** of the national budget to thieves.

**Recent scandals:**
- **NYS Scandal:** KSh 9 billion stolen while youth waited for jobs
- **KEMSA COVID Scandal:** KSh 7.8 billion stolen while patients died without ventilators
- **Ghost Schools:** KSh 16.6 billion paid to 14 schools that don't exist
- **Maize Scandal (2009):** KSh 2 billion stolen during a drought

### 3. How This Affects Your Daily Life

**HUNGER**
- **15.5 million Kenyans** go hungry every day
- **20 million people** live below the poverty line
- Yet irrigation money meant for farmers is stolen

**JOBS**
- **13% of young Kenyans** are unemployed
- **1.7 million university graduates** cannot find work
- Youth programs like NYS and Kazi Kwa Vijana lost billions to corruption

**EDUCATION**
- 14 'ghost schools' received KSh 16.6 billion
- Real schools lack teachers, books, and desks
- University students can't get loans while politicians steal

**HEALTH**
- Hospitals lack medicine
- Government spends **KSh 17 million DAILY** on tea and snacks
- That daily snack money could insure **1 million Kenyans** for a year

### 4. Your Constitutional Rights Are Being Violated

The Constitution guarantees you:
- **Right to food** (Article 43) - but 15.5 million go hungry
- **Right to healthcare** (Article 43) - but hospitals lack medicine
- **Right to information** (Article 35) - but debt contracts are hidden
- **Right to protest** (Article 37) - but 200+ were killed in 2024 protests

### 5. What Needs to Change

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. **Publish all debt contracts** - let citizens see what we owe
2. **Stop the daily KSh 17 million** on government snacks
3. **Prosecute corruption cases** within 24 months, not 6 years
4. **Enforce the Election Campaign Financing Act** (it exists but has never been used)

**LONG-TERM REFORMS:**
1. **Transparency:** All government contracts online
2. **Accountability:** Jail politicians who steal
3. **Participation:** Citizens involved in budget decisions
4. **Justice:** Constitutional rights actually enforced

### 6. What You Can Do TODAY

1. **REQUEST INFORMATION:** Use Article 35 to ask for budget documents
2. **ATTEND BUDGET FORUMS:** Show up at county meetings
3. **REPORT CORRUPTION:** File complaints with EACC
4. **VOTE WISELY:** Reject candidates with corruption records
5. **ORGANIZE:** Join with others in your community

### Remember:
- **Article 1:** Sovereignty belongs to YOU
- **Article 10:** Government must act with integrity
- **Article 201:** Public money must be managed openly

This is your country. The Constitution is your contract. Demand that it be honored.
