4. **Ghost Project Audit:** Identify and recover stolen funds

### Short-Term (6-24 months):

4. **Devolution Enhancement:** County accountability mechanisms

## Implementation Considerations

### Political Economy:
- Resistance from vested interests expected
- Cross-party consensus needed for major reforms
- Civil society mobilization essential

### Resource Requirements:
- Minimal fiscal cost for transparency measures
- Reallocation from wasteful expenditure (e.g., KSh 6.2B annual snacks budget)
- Donor support available for governance reforms

### Success Indicators:
- Debt-to-GDP stabilization
- Corruption Perception Index improvement
- Audit implementation rate increase
- Public trust in institutions recovery

## Conclusion

Kenya faces a governance crisis requiring urgent, comprehensive reform. 
The solutions exist within current legal frameworks but require political will 
and citizen mobilization for implementation.

**Next Steps:**
1. Form multi-stakeholder reform implementation committee
2. Launch public awareness campaign
3. Initiate targeted legal actions
4. Establish monitoring and evaluation framework
