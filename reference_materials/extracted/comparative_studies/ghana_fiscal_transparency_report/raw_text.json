The Government’s reforms have involved upgrading both the legislative and regulatory framework and financial management systems and procedures. Important examples of these new measures include: a new and more comprehensive public financial management law (the Financial Administration Act 2003); a strengthened system for controlling expenditure commitments and reporting of arrears; the creation of a centralized internal audit agency body in 2004; improvements in the scope and quality of the annual budget statement; and voluntary participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The benefits from several of these reforms are now beginning to flow through to fiscal management. Ghana already meets the standards of the fiscal transparency code in several areas. In particular: (i) the responsibilities of the different branches of government are clearly defined; (ii) a transparent and fairly comprehensive legal and administrative framework for budget preparation and execution has been put in place; (iii) the annual budget is based on a comprehensive and consistent quantitative macroeconomic framework; (iv) the budget statement discusses the main assumptions underlying the budget and provides an overview of the implementation of fiscal policies for the previous year and the objectives for the current year; and (v) budget data are presented on a gross basis, classified by institution and economic and functional category. In spite of the progress, the transparency of fiscal activities still falls short of the standards in a number of important areas. The most significant shortcomings are: (i) the coverage of the general and central government in the budget documents and, in particular, the fiscal reports remains incomplete; (ii) a significant amount of budget spending is conducted through transfers to statutory funds, the spending of which is not consolidated with that of central government and sometimes poorly reported; (iii) internal and external audits are ineffective, resulting in weak oversight and a major backlog of audit reports; and (iv) laws and regulations are implemented in a manner that hampers private sector activity. A strong and sustained commitment from the authorities is essential for Ghana to achieve the standards in these areas. Improvements in the coverage, timeliness and managerial orientation of fiscal reports and the production of information on amounts due for payments are essential, and can be achieved over a relatively short time horizon (1–2 years). It will also be key to take further steps to ensure that fiscal data from various sources meet basic data quality standards, are more consistent, and provide a more informative basis for policy making. Other important measures include: (i) upgrading the internal and external audit capacity; (ii) generating and publishing information on quasi-fiscal activities and contingent liabilities; and (iii) simplifying the presentation of the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and advancing the budget cycle to ensure a more efficient commencement to the fiscal year.",

The assessment has two parts. The first part is a description of practice, prepared by the IMF staff on the basis of discussions with the authorities and their responses to the fiscal transparency questionnaire, and drawing on other available information. The second part is an IMF staff commentary on fiscal transparency in Ghana. II. DESCRIPTION OF PRACTICE A. Clarity of Roles and Responsibilities Structure of government 2. The general government sector is defined broadly in accordance with the GFS manual. 1.1.1 Under the Constitution of 1992, Ghana has an executive—an elected President who is assisted by a Cabinet of Ministers—a Council of State, a unicameral parliament, and an independent judiciary. For budgetary and fiscal reporting purposes, the general government sector comprises the central government, including the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT), and local government. The core central government sector consists of 38 ministries with some 250 departments and agencies, the so-called MDAs. A number of statutory funds—including the District Assembly Common Fund (DACF), the Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETF) and the Road Fund—receive transfers from the central budget while being legally separate entities.2 In addition, some small extrabudgetary funds such as the Cocoa Roads Fund, Mineral Development Fund (see Appendix 1) and Women Development Fund, are part of central government. The local government sector comprises 110 Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs). These MMDAs have responsibilities in such areas as basic education, primary health care, and local infrastructure. Quasi-fiscal activities 3. The government carries out some quasi-fiscal activities through publicly owned enterprises. 1.1.4 1 Discussions on fiscal transparency were held in Accra during February 16–27, 2004. The staff team, comprising Messrs. De Broeck, Kinoshita, Thomas, and Webber met with officials from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, the Controller and Accountant-General’s Department, the Auditor-General’s Office, the ministries of health, education, roads and highways, private sector development, local government and rural development, and mines, the Minerals Commission, State Enterprises Commission, Divestiture Implementation Committee, and Bank of Ghana as well as representatives from private sector and nongovernmental research institutions. 2 According to the 2003 provisional outturn, transfers to these three statutory funds accounted for 11.5 percent of total central government expenditure. There are two additional statutory funds: the Petroleum Related Fund, transfers to which represented 0.4 percent of spending in 2003, and the National Health Insurance Fund, which was introduced in the 2004 budget but is not yet operational.",

These institutions maintain a number of branches for social purposes and provide loans to the agricultural sector and some large state-owned enterprises under conditions that do no reflect purely commercial decisions. In particular, Ghana Commercial Bank acts as the principal financier of the state-owned Tema Oil Refinery and has built up an exposure to the refinery that significantly exceeds prudent norms. These quasi-fiscal activities are documented in the Bank’s annual report, but the associated risks are not discussed in the budget in the context of putting policies in place to deal with them. The government also continues to fully own a significant number of nonfinancial enterprises, some of which engage in quasi-fiscal activities. These public sector enterprises have been converted into limited liability companies that in principle have an independent board of directors and management and in most cases conclude performance contracts with a State Enterprise Commission. Their annual reports itemize the activities carried out as per instructions of the sectoral ministries. The utility companies in the electricity and water sectors and the Tema Oil Refinery are subject to a regime of administered prices, the impact of which is not reported. Sizable subsidies on utilities and petroleum products cover part of the support to customers which these companies provide. A very low rate of return and absence of dividend payments on government provided equity, a level of indebtedness to public sector banks that exceeds prudential levels, and a persistent negative net-receivables position toward the government suggest that these companies also channel indirect subsidies to customers on behalf of the government. The operational losses reported in their annual financial statements provide a measure of such quasi-fiscal activities.3 Relations with nongovernment public sector agencies 4. The Bank of Ghana (BoG) is independent and is no longer engaged in quasi-fiscal activities. 1.1.4 The Bank of Ghana Act, 2002, enshrines price stability as the primary policy goal for the BoG and gives it operational independence. The Act sets up the BoG as an institution that is answerable to a Board of Directors—chaired by the Bank’s Governor— which is appointed according to clearly specified procedures and is not subject to oversight or instructions from the government or any other authority. The Act also establishes an independent monetary policy committee on which the government is represented and which is responsible for formulating monetary policy on a day-to-day basis. The BoG can finance the government through temporary advances and loans or through direct purchases of treasury bills and securities. The BoG Act limits government borrowing from the banking sector, including the BoG, and the public to 10 percent of total revenue in the given fiscal year, a ceiling that can only be exceeded in the event of an emergency and with parliamentary approval. According to well-specified legal provisions, the BoG acts as banker and fiscal agent for the government and state institutions, assists in managing the public debt, and advises the government on 3 Catriona Purfield, “The Challenge of Fiscal Sustainability in the Post-HIPC era in Ghana,” in IMF Country Report no. 03/134, May 2003, pp. 50–79, provides estimates of such operational losses during 1999–2001.",

The BoG Act establishes a General Reserve Fund and a Revaluation Account, the latter representing the net balance on the revaluation of BoG assets and liabilities as a result of changes in the value of the cedi. The Revaluation Account has a large debit balance reflecting losses from quasi-fiscal activities dating from the pre-2002 period. The BoG is required to transfer all its net income to this Account until the debit balance is settled, which will be facilitated by the Bank’s recapitalization in early 2004. Government relation with the private sector 5. Government involvement in the private nonfinancial sector through equity participation has been scaled down but, in spite of efforts to streamline the legal and regulatory framework, the private sector continues to face a heavy regulatory burden. 1.1.5 The government has sold most of its equity holdings in trade, agriculture and housing, with privatization receipts amounting to around 2¼ percent of GDP during 1999–2003. The government continues to own minority stakes in a number of companies, the book value of which was estimated at around ¾ percent of GDP at end-2002. As a rule, these are joint stock companies that are subject to commercial legislation and operate on a fully commercial basis. A number of initiatives have been set up to improve the transparency of the legal and regulatory framework governing private sector activity. A ministry of private sector development has been established to interface with the private sector to identify laws and regulations—often dating from an era in which government ownership and control were more prevalent—that hamper private sector activity.

      "- 6 - fiscal matters. The BoG Act establishes a General Reserve Fund and a Revaluation Account, the latter representing the net balance on the revaluation of BoG assets and liabilities as a result of changes in the value of the cedi. The Revaluation Account has a large debit balance reflecting losses from quasi-fiscal activities dating from the pre-2002 period. The BoG is required to transfer all its net income to this Account until the debit balance is settled, which will be facilitated by the Bank’s recapitalization in early 2004. Government relation with the private sector 5. Government involvement in the private nonfinancial sector through equity participation has been scaled down but, in spite of efforts to streamline the legal and regulatory framework, the private sector continues to face a heavy regulatory burden. 1.1.5 The government has sold most of its equity holdings in trade, agriculture and housing, with privatization receipts amounting to around 2¼ percent of GDP during 1999–2003. The government continues to own minority stakes in a number of companies, the book value of which was estimated at around ¾ percent of GDP at end-2002. As a rule, these are joint stock companies that are subject to commercial legislation and operate on a fully commercial basis. A number of initiatives have been set up to improve the transparency of the legal and regulatory framework governing private sector activity. A ministry of private sector development has been established to interface with the private sector to identify laws and regulations—often dating from an era in which government ownership and control were more prevalent—that hamper private sector activity. Other initiatives include the creation of a Business Law Division in the ministry of justice and a Ghana Investors’ Advisory Council to promote business law reform and improvements in the business climate. However, the business community continues to perceive the implementation of laws and regulations governing private sector activity as complex and burdensome.4 Moreover, the enforcement of claims and settlement of disputes through the judicial system are seen as costly and slow. 6.

Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) 3.1.3 The Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) was introduced as part of the Public Financial Management Reform Program (PUFMARP) initiated in 1996. The MTEF was implemented from fiscal year 1999, but suffered some major setbacks early on. An economic downturn during 1999–2000 led to a sharp shortfall in revenues relative to forecasts, forcing the authorities to cutbacks in cash releases. Ad hoc reductions in discretionary expenditure and arrears accumulation eroded the credibility of the MTEF’s indicative allocations for the outer years. Moreover, changes in the classification on the budget side were initially not accompanied by corresponding adjustments in the structure of the chart of accounts, resulting in a temporary breakdown in the regular fiscal reporting. Following an economic rebound in 2001 and the introduction of new expenditure reporting codes, the Government of Ghana (GoG) envisaged to revitalize the MTEF process with, however, only limited success thus far. The MTEF adopted in Ghana has the following key characteristics: • The Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) provides the overall policy basis and expenditure projections are consistent with the Strategy’s poverty reduction targets; • The MTEF incorporates an aggregate spending ceiling which is based on a consistent and comprehensive macroeconomic framework; • It presents MDAs’ expenditure estimates on a rolling three-year basis; • It classifies the annual spending envelopes under four heads, namely personnel emoluments (salaries and pensions); nonsalary administrative expenses; service expenditure; and investment expenditure; • It introduces a 15-digit expenditure classification that has the capacity to classify the budget on a broad administrative (cost center level), economic (items, subitems), and functional basis (objectives). The functional base of the budget classification in turn has a three-tier structure (objectives, outputs, and activities) that enables to link activities and outputs to specific MDA objectives. 1/ Ghana’s MTEF in principle could offer several major advantages: • Its medium-term perspective enables to take into account the out-year consequences of current policies and formulate intertemporal trade-offs; • The MDAs’ sectoral spending targets are linked to the priorities of the GPRS and formulated taking into account the aggregate resource envelope; • The MTEF expands the budget coverage by including most donor funds in the budget; • It integrates the recurrent and development/investment budgets; • It puts increased emphasis on performance as activities are expected to be planned and costed with a view to producing outputs that in turn should achieve objectives. In practice, however, the MTEF falls short of its potential as it tends toward being a form-filling exercise and is not yet getting established as a tool for rational allocation of resources, review of priorities, and decision making. More in particular: • The information included in the annual spending estimates is overly detailed. The number of activities reported by each MDA is very large (more than 2500 cost centers in total). The preparation process is work intensive and time consuming, and the voluminous nature of the documentation (up to forty volumes for the combined MDAs) counterproductive from the transparency point of view; • The functional classification of the annual estimates is wanting in several respects: (i) the classification by activities tends to overlap with the economic classification associated with it; (ii) outputs include a large number of overhead costs (such as training) that in many cases should be classified as activities; and (iii) the objectives are very broad and general and unlikely to be of much use in strategic analysis; • Items 1 and 2 (personnel emoluments and nonsalary administrative expenses), which are largest components of discretionary recurrent expenditure, are outside the MTEF prioritization process; • Expenditure allocations are still determined largely by incremental methods. In particular, estimates for the two out-years do not reflect genuine costing of programs or reprioritization but rather appear to have been derived by applying uniform growth factors (for GoG and donor-financed spending, respectively); • The coverage of donor funds and, in particular, the internally generated funds in the annual estimates remains incomplete; • The annual estimates are not fully translated into appropriations, expenditure authorisations and cash releases. Typically, personnel costs are overspent while investment ends up being underfunded; • The accounting system cannot report on activities, outputs, and objectives.

A statement on medium-term fiscal policy objectives, derived from the GPRS, provides the basis for the annual budgets. 3.1.1 The government does not apply fiscal rules, but it does announce and monitor explicit macrofiscal targets set out in the GPRS.17 The medium-term framework underlying the GPRS includes a specific target for the domestic debt-to-GDP ratio (50 percent reduction from end-2002 to end-2005). This debt sustainability objective has direct implications for annual domestic debt financing and repayments. The GPRS also includes targets relating to revenue growth, subsidies and domestic capital expenditures levels in particular. 27. The overall balance of the central government is the key indicator of the fiscal position of the government. 3.2.3 The budget statement (in its Annex, Table 2) provides an overall presentation of central government fiscal operations that largely conforms to GFS (GFSM, 1986) format. This shows the derivation of the fiscal balance from above the line revenue and expenditure transactions and the financing of the deficit from below the line. Both the overall cash balance and the primary balance are presented in the MTEF (multiyear) framework. 28. The budget presentation does not extend beyond central government. 2.1.1/3.2.3 Local government budgets are to be presented and reported to local legislatures, with copies referred to the MoFEP. Aggregate budget transfers to local assemblies, via the DACF, do not reveal the full extent of local government fiscal operations due to their access to locally generated revenues. Local government expenditure activities are an increasingly important contributor to economic activity under the government’s decentralization objectives. 29. The budget neither covers the quasi-fiscal operations of statutory and extrabudgetary funds nor those of the public corporations. 2.1.1/3.2.4 The quasi-fiscal operations conducted by SSNIT, a major investor in the local economy, and some of the largest public corporations are considered to be sizable. The budget covers these activities only through the estimates of the government’s contributions to SSNIT for public sector employees and subsidy payments to utility companies and Tema Oil Refinery.18 Other, nonbudgeted quasi-fiscal operations can also be significant, including implicit subsidies on petroleum products and utilities and the provision of health, educational and other social services, especially in rural areas (see also Appendix 1). The budgets and financial reporting of public corporations are prepared under their respective legislative requirements, but no attempt is made to capture their expenditures or economic impact within the budget. 17 For the 2004 budget, the key targets relate to real GDP growth (5.2 percent), inflation (less than 10 percent), gross foreign exchange reserves as a cover of imports (no less than 3 months), primary budget balance (surplus of 1.7 percent) and overall budget balance (deficit of 1.7 percent). 18 As at February 2004, the government reported a total of 33 fully state-owned corporations which are under the purview of the State Enterprises Commission and 75 subvented agencies. The expenditures of these organizations (and those of the statutory funds) must be accounted for under their specific regulations, but are not included in the budget or GFS reporting.",

The budgets and financial reporting of public corporations are prepared under their respective legislative requirements, but no attempt is made to capture their expenditures or economic impact within the budget. 17 For the 2004 budget, the key targets relate to real GDP growth (5.2 percent), inflation (less than 10 percent), gross foreign exchange reserves as a cover of imports (no less than 3 months), primary budget balance (surplus of 1.7 percent) and overall budget balance (deficit of 1.7 percent). 18 As at February 2004, the government reported a total of 33 fully state-owned corporations which are under the purview of the State Enterprises Commission and 75 subvented agencies. The expenditures of these organizations (and those of the statutory funds) must be accounted for under their specific regulations, but are not included in the budget or GFS reporting."

To help address this problem, the CAGD has embarked on a process of cleaning up unauthorized and redundant bank accounts of government agencies.19 Accountability for local government expenditures rests with the respective district assemblies and lower tiers.

The volume of expenditure arrears within the government finance system is difficult to gauge due to the absence of: (i) a standard definition for arrears; (ii) adequate reporting procedures; and (iii) the significant level of “disputed claims,” particularly in the road sector. 3.3.1 The authorities took action in 2003 and are continuing their efforts to identify and deal with outstanding budget arrears and disputed claims.

In light of the importance of revenues from the mining sector, which accounts for around 10 percent of GoG revenue, and the commitment of the government to transparency, this appendix provides a review of the current status of the sector’s revenue practices. This review covers relevant aspects of fiscal transparency with regard to management of Ghana’s mining industry assets, and includes a discussion of Ghana’s participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The review is structured in the same way as the main text of the fiscal transparency ROSCs, but applies only to those elements of the code of relevance to mining revenues.31 Clarity of roles and responsibilities Legal framework for mineral revenues 73. The legal framework for management of minerals is clearly defined. 1.2.2 The Constitution (Chapter twenty-one), the Minerals and Mining Law, 1986, and its 1994 Amendment Act, and the Minerals Commission Law, 1986, provide the overall legislative framework for the mining sector. The State is the owner of all minerals in their natural state within Ghana’s territory and the Ministry of Mines acting as its agent grants licenses to exercise mineral rights. The Minerals and Mining Law specifies the forms of mineral rights that the ministry can license, the duration of the license, the size of the concessions, and eligibility criteria and procedures for application. The Law also spells out the rights and obligations of a holder of mineral rights. The Minerals Commission has been set up to regulate and manage the utilization of mineral resources and coordinate policies with regard to minerals. Small-scale mining activities in the gold sector are governed by the Small-Scale Gold Mining Law, 1989. 74. The tax policy framework and fiscal regime covering the mining sector are clearly stated and rather comprehensively covered in law. 1.2.2 The fiscal regime for the mining sector is enshrined in the Minerals and Mining Law. The regime includes government rights to equity shares in mining companies (see discussion below). Article 22 requires mining companies to pay no less than 3 percent and, depending upon their profitability rate, up to 12 percent of their gross revenue as royalties. Article 23, as amended in 1994, subjects the mining companies to corporate income taxes—at standard rates. The Law’s Article 26 introduces a special regime for capital allowances and the carry forward of financial losses. Article 27 authorizes the mining companies to be exempt from customs duties on plants, machinery, equipment, and accessories imported for mineral operations.32 The legislation also leaves open the option to include “fiscal stability” clauses 31 For an overview of the mining sector in Ghana, see Bank of Ghana, “Report on the Mining Sector,” Research Department Sector Study, Vol. 1. No.2, November 2003. 32 However, with the coming into effect of the 2001 budget, plants, machinery and equipment have been subject to a 1 percent processing fee and all other imported items to a 5 percent import levy. The various exceptional exemptions could be considered as tax expenditures, in which case they should be reported in the budget documents. An alternative, and more practicable treatment, is to consider the totality of such arrangements as being the baseline tax regime for the mining industry.

All tax payments to the GoG are disbursed into the Consolidated Fund, while property taxes are paid to the District Assemblies. There are no explicit legal requirements for mining companies to provide social services to local communities. 75. Rights of companies to retain foreign exchange are covered by the law. 1.2.2 The Minerals and Mining Law, articles 29 and 30, permits mining companies that have earnings denominated in foreign exchange to retain in an external account at least 25 percent of such earnings with a view to meeting offshore obligations. The companies can negotiate higher retention rates with the Minerals Commission based on the nature of the project and the cost structure of the company. However, mining companies with retention levels above 60 percent have agreed to voluntarily repatriate 25 percent of their gross earnings into a foreign exchange account with a chosen Ghanaian commercial bank, bringing the effective retention rates into the 30–55 percent range. The Minerals and Mining Law regulates the conditions under which an external retention account can be operated and the type of payments that can be made from it.34 Extrabudgetary funds 76. The Mineral Development Fund operations are administratively clear but not well integrated in the national and local budgets. 1.1.3 The GoG has set up a Mineral Development Fund that through the Consolidated Fund receives 20 percent of mining companies royalties.35 Half of the Development Fund supports the mining agencies (the Mines and Geological Survey Departments and the Minerals Commission). The rest is transferred to the Office of the Administrator of Stool Lands to be distributed in the mining communities. In accordance with Article 267 of the Constitution, the Office of the Administrator of the Stool Lands can retain 10 percent of the payment while the remainder 90 percent is distributed to the local authorities in the following proportions: (i) the stools of the mining areas, 25 percent; (ii) the traditional authorities of the areas, 20 percent; (iii) the District Assemblies within the area of authority of which the stool lands are situated, 55 percent. The local expenditures are aimed at repair of environmental damage and development projects in mining communities. In part reflecting the complicated nature of the arrangement and the disbursement procedure through the Office of the Administrator of the Stool Lands, the legally prescribed payments to the three types of local authorities tend to be paid with a significant delay. Moreover, these local authorities tend to use these payments to finance expenditures other than those that benefit the local mining communities and do not properly account for and report the use of these monies. 33 For instance, in the context of the 2003 merger of the Ashanti Goldfields Company with AngloGold, the GoG undertook for the next 15 years not to take any actions that would impose additional tax obligations on the merged company. In particular, royalty payments and the corporate tax are fixed at 3 and 15 percent, respectively, for the next 15 years. 34 The BoG and the Minerals Commission both monitor the foreign exchange outflows and inflows—including the repatriation of retained export proceeds into domestic commercial banks and the partial settlement of bills with local contractors in foreign currency—of the mining companies, but the collected information is not made publicly available. 35 The Fund was created in 1993 by an administrative decision and does not have a basis in a legislative instrument.",

Quasi-fiscal activities and social obligations of mining companies are identified, but not considered as part of the budget process. 1.1.4 The annual reports of the major mining companies provide an overview of the social services provided to the mining communities.36 These typically involve educational and health care services, infrastructure and utilities, and the sponsoring of recreation and sports activities. The Chamber of Mines publishes a report on its members’ environmental and social activities in local communities. However, these elements are not considered as quasi-fiscal activities or implicit taxes in government budgets, and no aggregate quantitative information on social service spending by the mining industry is available. Indications are that in the major extraction sites, mining companies account for a significant share of the social infrastructure and provision of social services. As a result of the tariff structure for electricity consumption, mining companies, on par with other large consumers, also implicitly cross- subsidize small users. Government equity holdings 78. Government rights to equity holdings in mining companies are covered in the law. 1.1.5 According to Article 8 of the Minerals and Mining Law, the GoG is, without a financial contribution, entitled to a 10 percent interest in the rights and obligations of mineral operations that have been licensed and can acquire up to a further 20 percent interest on terms agreed with the mining lease holder. GoG equity holdings in selected mining companies are reported in the CAGD’s annual report and financial statements.37 Public availability of information Budget documentation of revenues 79. Mining-related revenues are publicly reported and included, but not separately identified, in the budget. 2.1.1 The main source of information on mining-related revenues is the Minerals Commission. The budget documents, notably the budget statement and the annual public accounts, do not identify separately such revenues. The Minerals Commission on a semi-annual basis releases a statistical overview of the mining industry.38 In addition to data on employment, output, and overall receipts, this overview contains information on the industry’s contribution to government revenue—broken down by main revenue category and expressed both in nominal amounts and as a share of total IRS collection—and the payments to stools, traditional councils, and district assemblies of mining areas. The Mineral Development Fund has an obligation to annually report on its activities, but there is no publicly available information on the use of the monies passed on by the Fund to the mining agencies. The 36 The annual reports of the two largest mining companies can be found at their websites, http://www.goldfields.co.za and http://www.ashantigold.com, respectively. 37 For instance, until the company’s recent merger, the GoG owned 17 percent of the ordinary shares in Ashanti Goldfields Company and one preference share (“Golden share”).

      "- 31 - APPENDIX I Quasi-fiscal activities and social obligations of the mining companies 77. Quasi-fiscal activities and social obligations of mining companies are identified, but not considered as part of the budget process. 1.1.4 The annual reports of the major mining companies provide an overview of the social services provided to the mining communities.36 These typically involve educational and health care services, infrastructure and utilities, and the sponsoring of recreation and sports activities. The Chamber of Mines publishes a report on its members’ environmental and social activities in local communities. However, these elements are not considered as quasi-fiscal activities or implicit taxes in government budgets, and no aggregate quantitative information on social service spending by the mining industry is available. Indications are that in the major extraction sites, mining companies account for a significant share of the social infrastructure and provision of social services. As a result of the tariff structure for electricity consumption, mining companies, on par with other large consumers, also implicitly cross- subsidize small users. Government equity holdings 78. Government rights to equity holdings in mining companies are covered in the law. 1.1.5 According to Article 8 of the Minerals and Mining Law, the GoG is, without a financial contribution, entitled to a 10 percent interest in the rights and obligations of mineral operations that have been licensed and can acquire up to a further 20 percent interest on terms agreed with the mining lease holder. GoG equity holdings in selected mining companies are reported in the CAGD’s annual report and financial statements.37 Public availability of information Budget documentation of revenues 79. Mining-related revenues are publicly reported and included, but not separately identified, in the budget. 2.1.1 The main source of information on mining-related revenues is the Minerals Commission. The budget documents, notably the budget statement and the annual public accounts, do not identify separately such revenues. The Minerals Commission on a semi-annual basis releases a statistical overview of the mining industry.38 In addition to data on employment, output, and overall receipts, this overview contains information on the industry’s contribution to government revenue—broken down by main revenue category and expressed both in nominal amounts and as a share of total IRS collection—and the payments to stools, traditional councils, and district assemblies of mining areas. The Mineral Development Fund has an obligation to annually report on its activities, but there is no publicly available information on the use of the monies passed on by the Fund to the mining agencies. The 36 The annual reports of the two largest mining companies can be found at their websites, http://www.goldfields.co.za and http://www.ashantigold.com, respectively. 37 For instance, until the company’s recent merger, the GoG owned 17 percent of the ordinary shares in Ashanti Goldfields Company and one preference share (“Golden share”). The Company made no dividend payments during 2001–03. 38 This information is made available at the Minerals Commission’s website, http://www.mincomgh.org."

There is no publicly available information on dividends from GoG equity participation in mining companies or on public sector contingent liabilities or tax expenditures associated with the mining industry. 80. To improve the transparency of resource revenue, the authorities have volunteered to participate in the EITI, but further improvement in data reconciliation is required. 2.1.1 The MoFEP and the Minerals Commission have agreed on a suitable format for the host government reporting template, along the lines of the EITI’s May 2003 reporting guidelines, and intend to issue the first transparency report before year-end. The legal framework and contracts between the GoG and mining companies permit full disclosure of payments to the government. However, the current arrangements for the collection of information by the Minerals Commission, the BoG, and MoFEP appear to fall short of what is needed to meet the EITI template standards.39 This reflects both gaps in the data provided by the mining companies, with regard to dividends, bonuses and fees in particular, and some of the more general weaknesses in the CAGD’s accounting and reporting systems. The authorities recognize the need to upgrade the resource revenue data collection and reporting systems. Open budget preparation, execution, and reporting Budgeting, fiscal policy, and mineral revenues 3.1.1 81. Most mineral revenues are fully reflected in the budget and accounts, but sustainability issues are not explicitly addressed in the budget. Mining revenues other than the earmarked 20 percent of royalties and the property taxes levied by the District Assemblies go to the central government. They are fully fungible with the other resources in the Consolidated Fund and spent through the standard appropriation process. Including personal income (PAYE) taxes, these mining revenues have accounted for around 10 percent of GoG revenue in recent years. The sector’s contribution to GoG revenue is expected to remain broadly unchanged in the coming years but, given the mature nature of most mining operations in Ghana, to diminish over the medium to long term. There are no policies in place to set aside part of the GoG mining revenues for the benefit of future generations. As indicated in the main text, fiscal risks arising from mineral revenue volatility are not explicitly considered in the budget documents. Accounting and administration of resource revenues 3.3.1 82. Standard collection and accounting procedures apply to mineral revenue receipts. Mining companies and small-scale miners are subject to the standard arrangements and procedures for the payment of personal income taxes (PAYE), corporate profit taxes, and import duties.40 The IRS is responsible for the assessment, collection and recovery of royalties and the disbursement of all royalties collected into the Consolidated Fund.41 The 39 The EITI guidelines can be found at http://www.dfid.gov.uk . 40 Standard procedures apply. However, some mining companies have requested the IRS to be allowed to settle their tax obligations in US dollar, the currency in which their accounts are denominated. 41 While major mining companies meet their tax obligations on a timely basis, most small-scale miners continue to operate in the grey economy and do not pay any taxes.",
