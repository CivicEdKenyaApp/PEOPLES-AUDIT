The\nGovernment’s reforms have involved upgrading both the legislative and regulatory framework and financial\nmanagement systems and procedures. Important examples of these new measures include: a new and more\ncomprehensive public financial management law (the Financial Administration Act 2003); a strengthened\nsystem for controlling expenditure commitments and reporting of arrears; the creation of a centralized internal\naudit agency body in 2004; improvements in the scope and quality of the annual budget statement; and\nvoluntary participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The benefits from several of\nthese reforms are now beginning to flow through to fiscal management.\nGhana already meets the standards of the fiscal transparency code in several areas. In particular: (i) the\nresponsibilities of the different branches of government are clearly defined; (ii) a transparent and fairly\ncomprehensive legal and administrative framework for budget preparation and execution has been put in place;\n(iii) the annual budget is based on a comprehensive and consistent quantitative macroeconomic framework;\n(iv) the budget statement discusses the main assumptions underlying the budget and provides an overview of\nthe implementation of fiscal policies for the previous year and the objectives for the current year; and\n(v) budget data are presented on a gross basis, classified by institution and economic and functional category.\nIn spite of the progress, the transparency of fiscal activities still falls short of the standards in a number\nof important areas. The most significant shortcomings are: (i) the coverage of the general and central\ngovernment in the budget documents and, in particular, the fiscal reports remains incomplete; (ii) a significant\namount of budget spending is conducted through transfers to statutory funds, the spending of which is not\nconsolidated with that of central government and sometimes poorly reported; (iii) internal and external audits\nare ineffective, resulting in weak oversight and a major backlog of audit reports; and (iv) laws and regulations\nare implemented in a manner that hampers private sector activity.\nA strong and sustained commitment from the authorities is essential for Ghana to achieve the standards\nin these areas. Improvements in the coverage, timeliness and managerial orientation of fiscal reports and the\nproduction of information on amounts due for payments are essential, and can be achieved over a relatively\nshort time horizon (1–2 years). It will also be key to take further steps to ensure that fiscal data from various\nsources meet basic data quality standards, are more consistent, and provide a more informative basis for policy\nmaking. Other important measures include: (i) upgrading the internal and external audit capacity;\n(ii) generating and publishing information on quasi-fiscal activities and contingent liabilities; and\n(iii) simplifying the presentation of the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and advancing the\nbudget cycle to ensure a more efficient commencement to the fiscal year.",

      "- 21 -\n48. Apart from timeliness issues, the “narrow base” budgeting on which the financial\naccounting reports are prepared greatly constrains their quality and usefulness. 3.4.1\nMoreover, there is little additional information of a managerial or performance nature that\nwould allow Parliament, the public or other interested parties to assess the quality and impact\nof expenditures undertaken. Efforts are being made to improve the coverage, quality and\ntimeliness of both financial statements and broader fiscal reporting, but it will take time\nbefore these efforts can have a significant effect. It is also important that financial\nmanagement is strengthened at the subnational level, particularly given the commitment to\ndecentralization in the Constitution (Article 240).\nFinal accounts\n49.

These efforts have been part of broader policies aimed at achieving\nmacroeconomic stabilization and enhancing the role of the private sector in the economy.\n61. Notable efforts have been made in upgrading the legislative and regulatory\nframework: 1.2.1\n(i) the new FAA has clarified and strengthened the overall legal framework for fiscal\nmanagement; (ii) the adoption of the Local Government Services Bill is expected to address\nfinancial management weaknesses at the local level through, among others, a better\nintegration of the decentralized units of the MDAs; (iii) an internal audit agency has been\ncreated and the internal audit units in the MDAs are being enhanced; (iv) efforts are being\nmade to streamline and make more transparent the legal and regulatory framework governing\nprivate sector activity; (v) an Audit Service Board to oversee the external audit function has\nbeen established; and (vi) the legislation on the Revenue Agency Governing Board has been\noperationalized.\n62.

These efforts have been part of broader policies aimed at achieving\nmacroeconomic stabilization and enhancing the role of the private sector in the economy.\n61. Notable efforts have been made in upgrading the legislative and regulatory\nframework: 1.2.1\n(i) the new FAA has clarified and strengthened the overall legal framework for fiscal\nmanagement; (ii) the adoption of the Local Government Services Bill is expected to address\nfinancial management weaknesses at the local level through, among others, a better\nintegration of the decentralized units of the MDAs; (iii) an internal audit agency has been\ncreated and the internal audit units in the MDAs are being enhanced; (iv) efforts are being\nmade to streamline and make more transparent the legal and regulatory framework governing\nprivate sector activity; (v) an Audit Service Board to oversee the external audit function has\nbeen established; and (vi) the legislation on the Revenue Agency Governing Board has been\noperationalized.\n62. Substantial efforts have also been made in improving procedures and\nprocesses: 3.3.1\n(i) a control system has been rolled out in the MDAs that will enable the improved generation\nof commitment and payment information; (ii) progress has been made in rationalizing\ngovernment banking arrangements; (iii) a NTRU has been set up to track internally generated\nfunds; (iv) the CAGD has begun to produce monthly budget execution reports that, while\nrelatively narrow in coverage, meet basic data quality standards; and (v) the scope and\nquality of the budget documents have improved, and the latter now provide a reasonable\nbasis for open discussion of fiscal policy.
