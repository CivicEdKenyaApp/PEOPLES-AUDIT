In line with the IMF’s 2018 Framework on Enhanced Fund Engagement on Governance,1 the diagnostic assessment focused on corruption vulnerabilities and governance weaknesses linked to corruption in macroeconomically critical priority areas of: (i) the anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism; (ii) fiscal governance (e.g., public financial management, tax policy and revenue administration, state enterprise management, and public procurement); (iii) central bank governance; (iv) financial sector oversight; and (v) enforcement of contract and protection of property rights. Annex 1 provides additional information on the methodology and scope of the Governance Diagnostic. Sri Lanka is an island nation that lies in the Indian Ocean off the coast of India and that is highly connected to the global market. The economy has begun the transformation from primarily agriculture to higher value- added industry and service sectors and has the potential to further diversify and upgrade its economic structure. As of now, the Sri Lankan economy relies primarily on tourism, tea export, clothing, rice, and other agricultural production. In recent years, a confluence of shocks and policy missteps led to a deep economic and governance crisis. Two years of low tourism revenues due to COVID, loss of market access, deep reductions in tax revenues, and the debt service burden depleted reserves. The economic downturn was further exacerbated by a series of policy choices, many of which generated gains for private individuals while saddling the nation with debts. The country defaulted and FX shortages led to nationwide power cuts, shortages of essentials, and long queues for petrol. The rupee depreciated by about 40 percent (in dollar terms) between February and March 2022. Inflation soared and the economy contracted sharply while the banking sector was put under extreme stress by a state-granted moratorium of domestic debt repayment. The poverty level nearly doubled from its pre-pandemic level to about 25.6 percent of the population living below the USD 3.65 poverty line. Popular protests against government policies and widespread corruption, starting in March 2022, spotlighted the role of a small number of connected individuals who wielded enormous power and authority. President Rajapaksa resigned in July 2022, and H.E. Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe assumed the Presidency later that month. President Wickremesinghe has set out a reform program designed to stabilise the economy and country featuring a combination of steps to restore fiscal and debt sustainability, improve governance, and reduce corruption risks. The program includes measures to cut spending, raise revenues, and restructure debts, while maintaining necessary social programs to meet severe social needs. A raft of governance changes is also envisioned, including steps to strengthen the independence of the central bank, and enhance the country’s ability to confront corruption and integrity issues. The IMF approved an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement with Sri Lanka in March 2023 to support the implementation of reforms required to address critical balance of payment issues. Sri Lanka continues to face severe economic, social and governance challenges. Despite tentative signs of macroeconomic stabilization with inflation moderating, exchange rate stabilizing, and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) rebuilding reserves buffers, social tensions remain high due to falling real incomes.

Specific weaknesses in each area can be summarised as the following: • Anti-corruption legal frameworks and institutional arrangements are in flux due to the very recent passage of the Anticorruption Act (“ACA”). The act substantially improved the legal environment for addressing corruption. Gaining full benefit of the improved legal framework hinges on the creation of a transparent and merit-based process, informed by input from acknowledged experts in governance and anticorruption, for selection of Commissioners of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), given their role in day-to-day operations. Improvement brought about by the passage of the ACA needs to be complemented by the drafting and enactment of a modern law on Asset Recovery. Rapid operationalizing of the ACA will be critical to address current corruption vulnerabilities associated with the lack of a functional system for receiving, publishing, and reviewing asset declarations by public officials, and procedural and competency issues in the investigation and prosecution of corruption cases. The ability of the current anticorruption arrangements to effectively prevent, identify, and sanction corrupt behaviour is further constrained by limitations on the sharing of information across institutions, such as among the Supreme Audit Agency, the Financial Intelligence Unit, and the Anticorruption Agency. Transparent standards for public officials, including a Conflict-of-Interest system, are lacking, and opportunities for public participation and oversight of official behaviour, including by civil society, are increasingly restricted. • While anti-money laundering mechanisms can contribute to reducing corruption vulnerabilities, current approaches to Anti-Money Laundering/Combatting Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) largely fail to support effective state action. Issues in legal definitions and processes to capture and share information on beneficial ownership of companies have not been addressed, since they were first observed in 2015. Current practices by financial institutions largely fail to identify suspicious transaction and prevent money laundering. At the same time, weaknesses in the legal framework, problems in domestic cooperation on corruption related issues between competent authorities, and issues in establishing effective protocols for collaboration with foreign jurisdictions impair sanctioning corrupt officials for money laundering offenses or recovering stolen assets. • The lack of a robust legal framework and poor processes utilised in Public financial management (PFM) create corruption vulnerabilities due to limitations in the coverage of the budget, the lack of transparency in the process used for managing commitments, and for poor investment planning and management. The acceptance of unsolicited capital investment proposals in processes that lack transparency and competition have contributed to a large and growing portfolio of “problem” projects and raised corruption concerns. Substantial governance weaknesses exist across the management of state-owned enterprises, including a lack of clarity in the government’s portfolio, the absence of an explicit state policy to guide the management of its financial stake, and limited regulatory guidance and monitoring of the selection of executives and representatives of the state on Boards of Directors. The lack of oversight and transparency around the operation of state enterprises enhances exposure to corruption vulnerabilities, especially regarding procurement and other forms of contracting, and capital investments. Weaknesses in internal audit and control processes generate additional governance challenges and place an excessive burden on the Auditor-General to identify corruption risks. The absence of effective mechanisms to follow up on audit findings and observations contributes to the persistence of problematic procedural and managerial practices while restricting accountability for past actions.

Multi-year waiting times for the resolution of contract disputes prevent reliance on courts for effective and fair resolution of disputes and encourage disputants to find ways, not always legal, to speed up adjudication. Widespread confusion over the allocation of property rights and the lack of progress in digitizing property records generates extensive long-term legal disputes and similarly promotes resort to opaque means to influence the resolution of disputes. Corruption risks around state- owned land, estimated at approximately 80 percent of the country, are particularly severe due to the combination of lack of clarity around titles, the absence of a property registry, and ambiguity in processes for the divestiture of state property. Concerns about the integrity of the judiciary have grown over time, given the strong incentives of private parties to use illicit payments as a way to solve legal problems that have little chance of being resolved in the near term, and have focused attention on the need to strengthen the independence and competency across the legal sector. The report highlights immediate and short-term measures to address key corruption issues, as well as structural reforms that require more time and resources but are essential to strengthen governance and initiate lasting change. A list of “priority” recommendations is provided below. They primarily focus on measures related to critical risks, including addressing gaps in existing legal frameworks and the public provision of essential information for oversight and monitoring. Priority recommendations are explored in more depth in the subsections of the report, which also contain more extensive recommendations, including structural and institutional measures to achieve more transparent and efficient governance that operates with integrity and in accordance with the rule of law. The recommendations are designed as a coherent approach to improving governance through a focus on: clarity of authority and responsibility for core functions; financial and operational independence of essential accountability and law enforcement institutions; transparency in government practices and performance, especially relating to the planning, spending, and accounting for the use of public funds and assets; inclusive, accessible, and rule-based means to enforce private agreements and challenge official behaviour; and efficient mechanisms for making information public and holding organizations and individuals to account for their performance and behaviour. The combination of short-term actions to deliver concrete and observable improvements and long-term structural initiatives to change how the public sector functions in Sri Lanka is essential to achieving the social and economic aspirations of the country. It is acknowledged that comprehensively addressing governance weaknesses would require medium – and long-term initiatives, significant resources, and prolonged efforts, including with support from Sri Lanka’s international partners. The recommendations coming out of this diagnostic will contribute to the formulation of governance and anticorruption policies and programs, improvement of the legal and institutional frameworks, as well as governance and anti-corruption reform measures agreed to in the Staff Level Agreement for an Extended Credit Facility Arrangement for Sri Lanka.

At the same time, laws on counter-terrorism were applied in ways that restricted public participation in monitoring and governance. 4. President Wickremesinghe has pledged to confront corruption and change the way the nation is governed. Government reform programs have been announced, including in areas such as fiscal and monetary policy, taxation, public financial management, and anticorruption. Government pronouncements and policy actions have consistently reflected the urgency of making visible progress in the fight against corruption and the appreciation that policy reforms are unlikely to be sustained without structural changes in how the government operates and the mechanisms by which public officials are held to account for their behaviour and performance. President Wickremesinghe has announced that his government is “committed to implementing anti-corruption practices through a government mechanism that emphasises accountability.”6 5. The quick passage of the 21st Amendment in September 2022, reimposing limits on the authority of the President, demonstrated the resolve to unwind the recent attacks on 5 Under the last Rajapaksa Government, ministerial portfolios of the Rajapaksa brothers accounted for 70% of the national budget. 6 Special Statement Delivered By President Ranil Wickremesinghe, June 1st 2023, https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/special-statement-delivered-by-president-ranil-wickremesinghe-full-text/ IMF | Technical Report – Sri Lanka Governance Diagnostic Assessment | 17"

Corruption issues have been at the forefront of the public dialogue on governance for years. The change of governments after the 2015 elections was associated with increasing popular concerns over rising levels of corruption. Notwithstanding, international assessments of governance and corruption, including Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index and the World Justice Project’s Rule of Index, show little alteration in the country’s performance across a range of governance issues. Sri Lanka’s scores from 2016 through 2022 remain relatively unchanged on factors like control of corruption and the rule of law and place it close to average for the region and income group.7 7. A more granular level analysis of corruption reveals a more nuanced story. Results from a detailed survey and interview-based study of corruption conducted in 2019 found a consistent perspective that corruption was pervasive across the country.8 While slightly more than one-third of respondents had direct experience with corruption, over 85 percent of the interviewed indicated that corruption happened regularly in the hiring of government workers and the awarding of government contracts. Among those who had experienced or witnessed an act of corruption, the encounter happened with a government official in 36 percent of respondents and with a member of Parliament in 35 percent. Grand corruption was perceived to be slightly more frequent than petty corruption – a finding that is quite atypical as citizens’ views on the frequency of corruption are often driven by their own experiences around accessing services (e.g., health care) or in the enforcement of law (e.g., traffic violations) and not related to the actions of higher-level bureaucrats. The incidence of corruption was understood to be similar for politicians and bureaucrats, a finding echoed by similarities in the perceived levels of corruption among ministers and parliamentarians.9 At the same time, until prompted, respondents did not view corruption as a critical problem, seemingly having accepted it as a regular part of governance in the country. 8.

Governmental reviews and investigations regarding specific cases, including Sri Lankan Airlines’ interactions with Airbus, the decision to sharply reduce the import tax on sugar in 2020, and the events around the issuing of bonds in February 2015, produced extensive public information on incidents involving high-level officials. While each of these examples differs in important aspects, they share common features in that they involve multiple state entities, including the Central Bank, that generated extensive profits for private parties while simultaneously saddling the state with costly debts.

Anti-Corruption Strategy 34. A Sri Lankan National Anti-Corruption Plan (NAP) was developed for the first time in 2019 (spanning 2019-2023). It was a potentially important step indicating Government awareness of the cost of corruption and the need for a more strategic and inclusive approach to combatting it. A wealth of data has demonstrated that well-designed National Anticorruption Strategies can assist in coordinating actions to confront corruption and strengthen governance, establishing authority and responsibility for implementation, and enabling inclusive monitoring of implementation progress and corruption trends.18 35. The NAP is both broad in span and deep in application. Its provisions cover five pillars of activity: A) Prevention Measures – including the establishment of a Corruption Prevention Division at CIABOC B) Value-Based Education and Community Engagement C) Institutional Strengthening of CIABOC and other Law Enforcement Agencies D) Law and Policy Reforms E) Monitoring and Evaluation 36. The primary burden of its implementation was assigned to CIABOC, although the implementation matrix set out in the NAP does identify other responsible agencies. Ideally, there would be a more detailed matrix assigning responsibility to particular departments or divisions within each agency, in order to avoid confusion or duplication of effort. While key performance Indicators are also set out, the timeline for implementation is vague, often identified as only ‘short-term’, medium- term’ or ‘long-term’. 37. The progress made in implementing the plan is unclear as limited public information has been provided. The years covered by the strategy have witnessed large-scale fluctuations in governance and economic conditions. There is little indication that the NAP succeeded in driving change or operated as a platform for collaboration among state institutions or across state and non- state actors. 18 See UNODC, National Anti-Corruption Strategies: A Practical Guide for Development and Implementation, 2015 for an overview and guidance on National anticorruption strategies.

It was a potentially important step indicating Government awareness of the cost of corruption and the need for a more strategic and inclusive approach to combatting it. A wealth of data has demonstrated that well-designed National Anticorruption Strategies can assist in coordinating actions to confront corruption and strengthen governance, establishing authority and responsibility for implementation, and enabling inclusive monitoring of implementation progress and corruption trends.18 35. The NAP is both broad in span and deep in application. Its provisions cover five pillars of activity: A) Prevention Measures – including the establishment of a Corruption Prevention Division at CIABOC B) Value-Based Education and Community Engagement C) Institutional Strengthening of CIABOC and other Law Enforcement Agencies D) Law and Policy Reforms E) Monitoring and Evaluation 36. The primary burden of its implementation was assigned to CIABOC, although the implementation matrix set out in the NAP does identify other responsible agencies. Ideally, there would be a more detailed matrix assigning responsibility to particular departments or divisions within each agency, in order to avoid confusion or duplication of effort. While key performance Indicators are also set out, the timeline for implementation is vague, often identified as only ‘short-term’, medium- term’ or ‘long-term’. 37. The progress made in implementing the plan is unclear as limited public information has been provided. The years covered by the strategy have witnessed large-scale fluctuations in governance and economic conditions. There is little indication that the NAP succeeded in driving change or operated as a platform for collaboration among state institutions or across state and non- state actors. 18 See UNODC, National Anti-Corruption Strategies: A Practical Guide for Development and Implementation, 2015 for an overview and guidance on National anticorruption strategies.

Finally, asset disclosure systems can promote key partnerships with civil society and journalists. 46. Several international instruments, including the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, include references and provisions on disclosure by public officials, making it a widely recognised tool. Additionally, regional, and international documents have provided valuable guidance for implementation.

Sri Lanka has had laws requiring asset and liability declarations since the 1970s.22 CIABOC has been responsible for administrating the system starting in the 1990s. The laws require that within three months of taking office, parliamentarians, judges, public officials of government departments, ministries, local authorities, chairpersons and staff of public corporations, candidates for elected public office, and elected officials declare their assets and liabilities, as well as those of their family members. However, serious shortcomings in verifying disclosures and addressing non-compliance were identified. Systems problems remain largely unaddressed, despite the passage of twenty years from the enactment of the laws. 48. Between 2019 and 2021, CIABOC – in collaboration with Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) and other NGOs – attempted to establish an effective asset declaration system. This aimed to increase public officials’ asset transparency by establishing an Office of Asset Disclosure, publishing an annual report on relevant prosecutions, and creating and publicising an online asset declaration portal. It built on a previous commitment with limited implementation, which aimed to amend the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Act. Unfortunately, no progress was made in establishing an online public portal for asset declaration, an Office of Assets Disclosure, or annual reports on prosecutions related to asset declaration verification. 49. While the Government proved unable to inform the public about its plans, TISL ran a highly visible information campaign on asset declaration. These included writing to members of parliament, publishing articles in the press, posting billboards, and creating social media campaigns. This brought asset declaration into the public discourse, generating demand for asset declaration among relevant civil society organisations and political parties. As a result, by February 2021, 12 individual parliamentarians had voluntarily published their asset declarations. This was a positive step, but the remainder of Sri Lanka’s 225 parliamentarians did not follow suit. 50.

It may also raise concerns with the competent authorities regarding specific transactions. 55. While the internal audit function is generally poorly developed in Sri Lanka, external audit has increasingly played a significant role in oversight and accountability. The Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) of Sri Lanka is the National Audit Office (NAO), headed by the Auditor-General (AG), which traces its history back to 1799. The 2018 Audit Act sets out the responsibilities of both the Auditor General and the Audit Office. The 2018 Act also established an Audit Service Commission, with responsibilities for securing the human and financial resources of the NAO, supporting improved performance, and reporting on NAO findings relating to fraud, negligence, misappropriation, or corruption. The Commission was abolished by the 20th Amendment, in 2020, and reinstated by the 21st Amendment, in 2022. 56. The brief and relatively turbulent history of the the Audit Service Commission points to recurring concerns around the ability of the NAO to audit all state authorities, and the follow- up of audit findings and observations. Legally, the NAO mandate extends to all state entities, but it has encountered issues with gaining access to records and cooperation with powerful agencies and state-owned enterprises. 57. There are also concerns that the link between auditing and accountability is too attenuated given limitations on the sharing of information between the Auditor-General and enforcement agencies, and relatively constrained follow-up of audit observations, findings, and recommendations. Section 9 of the National Audit Act effectively prevents the Auditor General from sharing information obtained during the course of an audit that raises corruption suspicions to law enforcement bodies in real time, preventing possible investigations and arrests from taking place – S.9(2) of the Act in fact creates an offense of sharing information in (the very limited) circumstances other than those set out in s.9(1)(a)-(c). 58. Without recourse to sharing information directly with enforcement agencies, the impact of NAO’s work is reliant upon the efforts of the Sri Lankan Parliament. NAO audit reports are submitted to Parliament for scrutiny by the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) and the Committee on Public Enterprise (COPE). There have been issues, however, over the composition of the committee and the speed at which it functions. As is the case in most jurisdictions that follow the ‘Westminster’ model, the COPA and COPE should be chaired by a member of the opposition, to ensure fairness, and the appearance of fairness, in the scrutiny process. However, this principle has not always been followed, recently. A further issue is that the Committee only sits when Parliament sits. President Rajapaksa’s decision to dissolve parliament during the COVID crisis brought into stark relief the impact of current rules on parliamentary oversight of accountability. To remedy this issue – and the resulting backlog of reports – COPA and COPE should be constituted as permanent bodies. 59.

To remedy this, a Code for Commission Prosecutors should be created and implemented. Such a Code is a mechanism adopted in a number of common-law jurisdictions34 and has met with considerable success. The Code will consist of a two-stage process that requires the prosecutor to consider: 1) Is there sufficient reliable and credible evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction? Prosecutors must consider what the defence case may be, and how it is likely to affect the prospects of conviction. A case which does not pass the evidential stage must not proceed, no matter how serious or sensitive it may be. 2) Is it in the public interest to proceed with the charge? This consists of seven considerations. a) How serious is the offense committed? b) what is the level of culpability of the suspect? c) what are the circumstances of and harm cause to the victim? d) what was the suspect’s age and maturity at the time of the offense? e) what is the impact on the community? f) is prosecution a proportionate response? g) do sources (e.g. informants) require protecting? Through consistent application of the Code, the Commission will ensure consistency and transparency of its decision-making processes. Points to Prove guide 78. To further assist with the first stage of this process, a ‘Points to Prove’ (P2P’) guide for each of the most common corruption-related offenses should be created. Taking individual offenses, the P2P should identify each of the component parts of the offenseand set out examples of how each of those component parts – or points – can be established evidentially. This ensures that all of the evidence necessary to establish the complete offense is adduced in court, creating greater certainty about the proceeding with the case further, and in the event the case goes to trial, ensuring that no gaps are left for the court to question. 79. A P2P guide also ensures that there is effective communication between the investigative and prosecutorial arms of the authority because it ensures that there is common understanding about what investigative leads ought to be prioritised and why it is necessary to gather certain pieces of evidence and not others.

But it is in those same cases (sometimes high profile and complex) that the accusation of political influence is often levelled at the Commission.

It is a virtual hub which has a secure communications channel. The International Anti-Corruption Coordination Centre (IACCC) could also be of considerable assistance to the Commission. During the 2016 Global Anti-Corruption Summit, the participants committed to establishing the IACCC, which has been operational since 2017. It is hosted by the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) but has specialist operational officers embedded in the Centre from Interpol, the USA (FBI and DHS), Canada (RCMP), Australia (Federal Police), New Zealand (Serious Fraud Office) and Singapore (CPIB). The IACCC engages in intelligence sharing with member countries and disseminates intelligence packages to other jurisdictions. It also receives referral grand corruption cases from external jurisdictions and takes new members. A greater involvement with the IACCC would be beneficial not only for the Sri Lankan authorities but also for the IACCC, as it continues to build a global picture of grand corruption.

Government policies, rules, and practices are often opaque. A number of weaknesses regarding the transparency of anticorruption practices have already been noted in this section, and additional transparency issues are noted in each of the subsequent chapters. In many of these instances, the lack of transparency is particularly damaging to trust in official practices, as observers are left to speculate on how government functions. In these cases, the appearance of conflict can have dramatic consequences for the willingness of individuals to follow rules (like paying taxes) or invest in formal economic activities. 94. Sri Lanka has taken important steps in establishing the right to information and creating an institutional framework for protecting those rights. The Right to Information Commission (‘RTIC’) was created by the Right to Information Act, No. 12 of 2016 (‘RTI Act’), to hear complaints of non-compliance by public authorities of their disclosure obligations, and to recommend disciplinary actions against offending officials. It also has the power to prosecute those who commit offenses defined in the RTI Act. Given this mandate, it plays an important role in championing the right to information and fostering an (embryonic) culture of transparency among public authorities.

Experience to date has demonstrated the Commission’s ability to require government agencies to disclose a wide variety of information requested by individuals.40 95.

In addition to agency-specific efforts, a government-wide effort will be needed to create and maintain a Transparency Portal with reliable and updated information essential for holding government accountable for performance. The Ministry of Media also has a vital role to play in supporting more proactive and consistent disclosure of information. 98. The bridge between public access to information and greater accountability for behaviour and performance is built through platforms for public engagement in governance. Rules promoting a responsible and free press are one example of such a platform since such rules provide investigative journalists the space to carry out their important work in identifying and publicising official misbehaviour. Sri Lanka has benefitted greatly from its robust and noisy media space, and institutions like the Centre for Investigative Reporting (CIR). It is vital for that civic space to be respected and protected, building upon existing efforts such as the inclusion of work with the CIR envisaged in the National Action Corruption Plan. 99. A more direct platform for engagement in anticorruption work are the rules relating to the treatment of anticorruption whistleblowers – individuals who share information relating to corrupt acts of officials. International experience, including that in the United States, has repeatedly demonstrated the importance of whistle-blowers for anticorruption efforts. Private information sources are particularly vital in identifying corruption, especially given the lengths that parties go to hide their behaviour and co-opt official monitors. Well-defined principles exist to support appropriate treatment and protection of these information sources. 100. Sri Lanka does not currently have a fully functioning dedicated whistleblowing scheme for public officers. Following the first review cycle of the UNCAC, recommendations were made by UNODC that Sri Lanka introduce additional measures within the domestic legal system to ensure that persons reporting information on corrupt practices are protected against unjustified treatment (as required by Article 3 of UNCAC). These provisions would also support the better protection of witnesses and victims of crime under the ‘Assistance to and protection of victims of crime and witnesses Act’ No 4 of 2015. Under the provisions of that Act, a person is protected if s/he makes a complaint to a law enforcement agency, but it does not provide for instances of whistleblowers. 101. The ACA provides for the protection of the identity of informers, whistleblowers, and witnesses and other assisting the Commission. In addition, the Commission has the power to take any measures necessary to ensure the safety of any person assisting the Commission, such as requiring the police to provide physical protection to the person. However, the law also contains a number of provisions which imperil whistleblowing. Section 119 will allow for the prosecution of persons who make false allegations to the Commission ‘knowing such allegation to be false or having reason to believe that such allegation does not constitute an offense’. Similarly, section 122 creates an offense of ‘knowingly giving false or misleading information to the Commission.’ Section122, in particular, is widely drafted, meaning it could be used inappropriately whereby someone who provides ‘misleading information’ (which is not further defined in the Bill) could be prosecuted by the very agency to which they are seeking to provide information about the wrongdoing of others. 102.

While higher-level coordination and information sharing is present, there is an absence of clear strategy and technical coordination mechanisms to pursue money laundering investigation in parallel with corruption investigation. While the legal barrier under the current legal framework is presently a challenge to effective implementation, Sri Lanka also does not have a clear national strategy and coordination mechanisms to pursue parallel corruption and money laundering investigations that could help identify solutions notwithstanding the legal barriers. Exchange of information appears to be generally on an ad-hoc basis. Access by police to information held by CIABOC has been restricted until very recently due to legal constraints. Information provided by the FIU to the CIABOC was largely a one-way sharing without useful feedback received. Lack of technical competencies of law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute money laundering cases relating to corruption is also one of the contributing factors to low level of successful money laundering conviction relating to corruption. Asset Recovery 111. Measured against international standards, substantial gaps exist in the current legal framework of Sri Lanka concerning the identification, recovery and return of proceeds of crime. Sri Lanka currently relies on the PMLA, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act and the Criminal Procedure Code for the confiscation and recovery of assets. The 2018 report by the Implementation Review Group (IRG) of the UNCAC48 on Sri Lanka acknowledged progress made by Sri Lanka on requirements relating to UNCAC Chapter V on Asset Recovery. However, the IRG provided additional measures that need to be adopted to ensure Sri Lanka’s legal framework is fully aligned with UNCAC requirements, as well recommendations to adopt global good practices in this area. Under the FATF standards, Sri Lanka is still assessed to be Partially Compliant in relation to its technical compliance to Recommendation 4 on Confiscation and Provisional Measures. This is largely due to the lack of confiscation measures relating to third parties and lack of mechanisms for managing or disposing of property frozen, seized and confiscated. Sri Lanka is currently working on establishing a comprehensive framework for asset recovery through the proposed Proceeds of Crime Act. 112. The low level of successful asset recovery and return relating to corruption reflects the low level of parallel investigations, the existence of complex court processes and the lack of technical expertise. While the PMLA provides the necessary power to forfeit stolen assets, implementation of this power is still largely ineffective particularly in the country’s higher risk areas such as corruption. The low rates of parallel investigation and prosecution of money laundering offenses translates to lower confiscation of proceeds of crime. This indicates that criminals are not being prevented from profiting from the proceeds of crime. Pursuing confiscation of proceeds of crime under the PMLA also requires meeting numerous court application requirements which can be time consuming. Delays in court processes has further added to the challenges for an effective asset recovery system. Lack of technical expertise and staffing resources of law enforcement agencies had also limited the ability to pursue asset recovery. 48 See: https://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/WorkingGroups/ImplementationReviewGroup/ExecutiveSummaries2/V1803684 e.pdf IMF | Technical Report – Sri Lanka Governance Diagnostic Assessment | 48",

This lack of a strategy, combined with limited attention to the issue and technical issues concerning the pursuit have all contributed to the creation of the current ineffective system. The MER 2015 also highlighted absence of relevant and reliable statistics relating to asset confiscation as an additional challenge in aligning policies and practices to effectively recover stolen assets and deter corruption. Beneficial Ownership of Legal Persons 114. Since the 2015 MER, Sri Lanka has yet to address the deficiencies relating to transparency of beneficial ownership of legal persons49 in its legal framework. This includes the absence of requirement for companies or company registry to obtain or hold up-to-date information of the companies’ beneficial owners. Further, the concept and definition of beneficial ownership is not included in the Companies Act.50 There is also no mechanism to facilitate timely access by competent authorities to beneficial ownership information. To this end, the Registrar General of Companies working together with the FIU and other relevant authorities, has formulated draft amendments to the Companies Act to fully align its legal framework for legal persons with the FATF standards. These draft amendments are pending final review by the authorities for submission to Parliament for approval and adoption. 115. Law enforcement agencies currently access beneficial ownership information through records maintained by financial institutions. While the Companies Registrar maintains basic legal information on companies, given the current legal gaps, beneficial ownership information is not widely available through the Registrar. Information provided by the Companies Registrar to the law enforcement agencies is mainly limited to basic, legal information of companies. Law enforcement agencies also have access to records held by financial institutions. Nevertheless, given the gaps in the current Companies Act, information provided by companies to their financial institutions on beneficial ownership might not be comprehensive or accurate. 116. Sri Lanka plans to develop implementing regulations once amendments to the Companies Act are adopted, but lack of operational capacity may hinder effective implementation. The authorities have yet to formulate a clear mechanism for the collection and verification of, and access to the beneficial ownership information to be maintained at the Companies Registrar, in line with the changes to be introduced through amendments to the Companies Act. The Registrar General of Companies intends to leverage the existing electronic registration system, but existing operational issues in the electronic system still need to be addressed for that to be feasible. The lack of competent and adequate resources at the Registrar, particularly on beneficial ownership requirements and awareness, pose a challenge to effective implementation of the beneficial ownership framework in Sri Lanka. 49 Sri Lanka was assessed as “Non-Compliant” for Recommendation 24: Transparency and Beneficial Ownership of Legal Persons in the 2015 MER. 50 Nevertheless, the concept and definition of beneficial owner are stipulated in the Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Rules 2016, applicable on all financial institutions (except for the insurance sector which is provided under the CDD Rules 2008 for insurance sector).

The MER 2015 also highlighted absence of relevant and reliable statistics relating to asset confiscation as an additional challenge in aligning policies and practices to effectively recover stolen assets and deter corruption. Beneficial Ownership of Legal Persons 114. Since the 2015 MER, Sri Lanka has yet to address the deficiencies relating to transparency of beneficial ownership of legal persons49 in its legal framework. This includes the absence of requirement for companies or company registry to obtain or hold up-to-date information of the companies’ beneficial owners. Further, the concept and definition of beneficial ownership is not included in the Companies Act.50 There is also no mechanism to facilitate timely access by competent authorities to beneficial ownership information. To this end, the Registrar General of Companies working together with the FIU and other relevant authorities, has formulated draft amendments to the Companies Act to fully align its legal framework for legal persons with the FATF standards. These draft amendments are pending final review by the authorities for submission to Parliament for approval and adoption. 115. Law enforcement agencies currently access beneficial ownership information through records maintained by financial institutions. While the Companies Registrar maintains basic legal information on companies, given the current legal gaps, beneficial ownership information is not widely available through the Registrar. Information provided by the Companies Registrar to the law enforcement agencies is mainly limited to basic, legal information of companies. Law enforcement agencies also have access to records held by financial institutions. Nevertheless, given the gaps in the current Companies Act, information provided by companies to their financial institutions on beneficial ownership might not be comprehensive or accurate. 116. Sri Lanka plans to develop implementing regulations once amendments to the Companies Act are adopted, but lack of operational capacity may hinder effective implementation. The authorities have yet to formulate a clear mechanism for the collection and verification of, and access to the beneficial ownership information to be maintained at the Companies Registrar, in line with the changes to be introduced through amendments to the Companies Act. The Registrar General of Companies intends to leverage the existing electronic registration system, but existing operational issues in the electronic system still need to be addressed for that to be feasible. The lack of competent and adequate resources at the Registrar, particularly on beneficial ownership requirements and awareness, pose a challenge to effective implementation of the beneficial ownership framework in Sri Lanka. 49 Sri Lanka was assessed as “Non-Compliant” for Recommendation 24: Transparency and Beneficial Ownership of Legal Persons in the 2015 MER. 50 Nevertheless, the concept and definition of beneficial owner are stipulated in the Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Rules 2016, applicable on all financial institutions (except for the insurance sector which is provided under the CDD Rules 2008 for insurance sector).

AML/CFT supervision, which is jointly carried out by the FIU, CBSL, SEC and IRCSL on financial institutions51, has adopted a risk-based supervisory framework, although lack of resources may hinder effective implementation of the framework. ML/TF risk data collection template and risk management questionnaires are disseminated to all financial institutions on an annual basis. Further, SEC and IRCSL conducts risk assessment and prepare the onsite supervisory plan for securities and insurance sectors respectively, and the FIU for banks, finance companies, restricted dealers with the DFE, MVTS providers and primary dealers. Data and information obtained from these tools are used to inform onsite supervisory plan. The FIU has issued guidance notes on beneficial ownership (2018), suspicious transactions reporting (2018) and PEPs (2019) to improve compliance by financial institutions. Thematic reviews on implementation of PEPs and beneficial ownership requirements by banks were conducted within the past three years. The COVID-19 pandemic had impacted the number of onsite inspections carried out on financial institutions in 2020 (11 onsite) and 2021 (5 onsite). As the pandemic situation improved, the authorities were able to conduct more onsite inspections in 2022 (38 onsite). Nevertheless, lack of resources, particularly at the FIU, limits the supervisory activities on AML/CFT, given that the FIU is also responsible for AML/CFT supervision of designated non-financial businesses and professions, including Casinos, Real Estate Agents and Gem and Jewelry Dealers. 118. Supervisory enforcement actions and sanctions have been imposed on financial institutions. The FIU has a range of sanctions that could be utilised, including warning letters, show cause letters and monetary penalties which have been imposed for AML/CFT violations. Prioritization of supervisory activities towards areas of higher risks as informed by the findings of the NRA as well as past findings of onsite inspections, could alleviate the pressure from constraint in adequacy of supervisory resources, while positioning its AML/CFT supervision to be appropriately risk-based.

There is lack of receipt and dissemination of financial intelligence to support investigation and prosecution of corruption-related money laundering cases, commensurate with the corruption risk of Sri Lanka. The number of suspicious transaction reports (‘STR’s) relating to potential corruption remains very low, despite multiple outreach activities by the FIU. (Table 9). This has led to an extraordinarily low number of disseminations of financial intelligence reports to law enforcement agencies on corruption-related cases, which appears severely at odds with the reported incidence of corruption in the country. (Table 10). This may reflect the low level of understanding by reporting entities on corruption-related risks, as well as the absence of sanctions for non-reporting.

This section discusses key issues of strengthening governance in managing public finances with a particular focus on addressing weaknesses that are associated with corruption risks. Good fiscal governance including a sound public financial management (PFM) system is an important driver of integrity, transparency, and accountability and reduced vulnerabilities to corruption. This section focuses on “hotspots” where governance weaknesses in PFM have created distinct corruption vulnerabilities. This emphasis should not detract from the overall understanding that a strong PFM system generally helps to reduce corruption and other fiduciary risks and therefore the broader PFM reform agenda for Sri Lanka is highly relevant to reducing corruption. 122. The recent crisis has placed great stress on Sri Lanka’s fiscal position. A series of external shocks combined with questionable policy choices in 2019 left the country with a very tight fiscal space. The effects of the COVID pandemic, ratched up emergency spending needs at the same time that decisions on tax policy and investments drastically reduced public revenues. Fiscal deficits reached 12.1 percent of GDP in 2020 and 11.6% of GDP in 2021.

Good fiscal governance including a sound public financial management (PFM) system is an important driver of integrity, transparency, and accountability and reduced vulnerabilities to corruption. This section focuses on “hotspots” where governance weaknesses in PFM have created distinct corruption vulnerabilities. This emphasis should not detract from the overall understanding that a strong PFM system generally helps to reduce corruption and other fiduciary risks and therefore the broader PFM reform agenda for Sri Lanka is highly relevant to reducing corruption. 122. The recent crisis has placed great stress on Sri Lanka’s fiscal position. A series of external shocks combined with questionable policy choices in 2019 left the country with a very tight fiscal space. The effects of the COVID pandemic, ratched up emergency spending needs at the same time that decisions on tax policy and investments drastically reduced public revenues. Fiscal deficits reached 12.1 percent of GDP in 2020 and 11.6% of GDP in 2021. This deteriorating fiscal position SRI LANKA during Covid led to Sri Lanka’s debt raising to unsustainable levels, which together with depletion of foreign initial resulted in large-scale direct lending to the government by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and culminated in the suspFeignusiroen 2 o. fS drei bLat nsekrav:i cFiinsgc ainl S2e0c2t2o.r Tax cuts in late-2019 and pandemic-related spending Public debt and financing needs have increased to hFaivgeu lreed t1o. dCoeunblter-adilg Git ofisvcearl ndemficeitnst i nO 2p0e20ra-2t2io. ns Fuignsuurseta 2in.a Pbuleb lelivce lDs. ebt and Gross Financing Needs Following a policy reversal in 2019, the tax revenue to Source: Request for an extended arrangement under the extended fTuhned lfaarcgileit yi,n Mtearercsht b2i0ll2 s3e. verely squeezes fiscal space for GDP ratio fell to below 8 percent, among the lowest in the growth-enhancing spending. world. 123. The crisis has served to highlight long-standing underlying fiscal governance issues that have constrained performance and exposed the nation to high levels of corruption risks. Despite the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Law, the government has struggled to maintain fiscal discipline due to a combination of overly positive revenue forecasts and challenges in reigning in spending in a context of weak accountability for the adherence to fiscal rules.

Public Investment Management 133. Some elements of the public investment management (PIM) process reflect principles of good practice. The Department of National Planning (NPD) reviews investment projects proposed by line ministries and includes them in a rolling four-year Public Investment Program (PIP) to align public investment with the government’s policy priorities. The PIP for 2021-2024 has been prepared and published with an aim to provide a medium-term perspective to the Government’s capital budget and directs the process of annual budget preparation. One of the nine key policy cornerstones of the PIP 2021-2024 is “Country Free from Corruption”. Capacity exists for oversight by the MoF of the implementation of major projects, including a project reporting/tracking framework and a policy for evaluation. The Department of Project Management and Monitoring monitors and evaluates investment projects and has issued several operational documents to guide the government agencies such as a detailed operational manual on project submission format and criteria to select the priority projects. It also furnishes a quarterly monitoring report to the Cabinet of Ministers in support of appropriate strategic and policy decisions related to mega-scale development projects.

Public Investment Management 133. Some elements of the public investment management (PIM) process reflect principles of good practice. The Department of National Planning (NPD) reviews investment projects proposed by line ministries and includes them in a rolling four-year Public Investment Program (PIP) to align public investment with the government’s policy priorities. The PIP for 2021-2024 has been prepared and published with an aim to provide a medium-term perspective to the Government’s capital budget and directs the process of annual budget preparation. One of the nine key policy cornerstones of the PIP 2021-2024 is “Country Free from Corruption”. Capacity exists for oversight by the MoF of the implementation of major projects, including a project reporting/tracking framework and a policy for evaluation. The Department of Project Management and Monitoring monitors and evaluates investment projects and has issued several operational documents to guide the government agencies such as a detailed operational manual on project submission format and criteria to select the priority projects. It also furnishes a quarterly monitoring report to the Cabinet of Ministers in support of appropriate strategic and policy decisions related to mega-scale development projects. The government has in place a national agency for public-private partnerships to consider opportunities for private-sector investment in public-sector entities and initiatives. 134.

Procurement 142. The authorities recognise that public procurement remains an area of governance weakness, with associated corruption vulnerabilities, despite attempts to improve its effectiveness. Public procurement plays a vital role in managing public finance to ensure value for money and integrity in public expenditure. Procurement of goods and works constitute a major share of the Sri Lanka government expenditure as the largest buyer of goods, services and works in the domestic market. In 2017, Sri Lanka’s spend on public procurement constituted 5.3 percent of GDP.64 According to the 2022 Interim Budget Speech, one of the key spending items causing the increase in expenditure in the revised budget 2022 was procurement cost escalation (food, medicine, fuel etc.).

Procurement 142. The authorities recognise that public procurement remains an area of governance weakness, with associated corruption vulnerabilities, despite attempts to improve its effectiveness. Public procurement plays a vital role in managing public finance to ensure value for money and integrity in public expenditure. Procurement of goods and works constitute a major share of the Sri Lanka government expenditure as the largest buyer of goods, services and works in the domestic market. In 2017, Sri Lanka’s spend on public procurement constituted 5.3 percent of GDP.64 According to the 2022 Interim Budget Speech, one of the key spending items causing the increase in expenditure in the revised budget 2022 was procurement cost escalation (food, medicine, fuel etc.). The size and scale of public procurement means that even relatively minor weaknesses could be associated with substantial corruption risks.65 143. Several procurement irregularities have been identified by different parties in the government. The reports of the MoF, the Auditor-General’s Department, and the Department of Management of Audit indicate malpractices have led to inefficiencies and waste of scarce resources of the Government in the context of tight fiscal space.66 These issues include lack of procurement planning, not using relevant procurement procedures stipulated by the Procurement Guidelines, inadequate competitiveness in the selection procedure, accepting unsolicited proposals for high value projects, poor contract management, lack of knowledge and capacity of the officials in procurement, 64 How governments spend: Opening up the value of global public procurement, Open Contracting Partnership, 2020. 65 E-Government Procurement: Enabling Business through Efficient Systems, Verite Research Report, 2017. 66 Ministry of Finance, Annual Report 2021; Auditor-General’s Department reports on Special Audit on Procurement of Petroleum Products by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation during the period from 1 June 2011 to 30 June 2012, Special Audit Report on Evaluation of the Procurement Process of Purchasing Coal for the Lakvijaya Coal Power Plant in Norochcholai for the Period of 2022- 2025, Special Audit Report on Procurement of 96,000 Metric Tons of Organic Fertilizer; The State of State Owned Enterprises, 2022, Chapter 7 COPE inquiries into SOEs, https://soe.lk/ IMF | Technical Report – Sri Lanka Governance Diagnostic Assessment | 63"

The decision seems to confirm Cabinet’s unconstrained discretion when deciding matters relating to public procurement. Lack of monitoring and independent review 149. The governance and corruption risks associated with complex and opaque procurement procedures are exacerbated by a lack of compliance monitoring, adding further incentives and opportunities for rent-seeking, and creating significant delays and inefficiencies in procurement. Procurement is not systematically monitored either by the Department of Public Finance or the NPC. Monitoring of procurement practices is particularly weak in the first two levels (departmental and ministerial levels). While the Ministry of Finance gathers procurement monitoring data, there is no central database to produce standard analytical reports and analyses of the effectiveness of procurement. This lack of a mechanism to monitor adherence with the PG often results in violations of the rules and financial losses, which are only revealed when there is an ex-post audit by the AG’s Department. 150. The appeals mechanism for most procurements is not independent, yet many procurements are subject to appeal and court proceedings. Complaints can be lodged with the NPC, the Procurement Appeals Board, or the Supreme Court. The setup is open to vulnerabilities e.g., conflict of interest, high degree of executive influence, and lack of independent review. For instance, at the ministerial level, the appeal mechanism requires bidders to submit complaints to the relevant Ministry Secretary. At the Cabinet level, the Procurement Appeal Board (PAB) has been established since 2005. However, the three members of the PAB are appointed by Cabinet, on recommendation of the President and the findings of the PAB do not need to be considered by the Cabinet (see above Daewoo Engineering and Construction Co.

The Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) identified significant issues with the bidding processes such as failure to follow a competitive bidding process.73 The Procurement Guidelines provide ethical standards, general prohibitions on corrupt activities, conflict of interest, and the acceptance of gifts or inducements, however, these processes are not being practiced consistently. The lack of national procurement performance standards and a performance assessment system for officials involved in procurement decision-making, implementation, and the administration of contracts hamper good public procurement management and timely delivery. 73 For instance, in 2021, the COPE directs the Ministry of Industries to investigate the sale of 85,000 MT of Ilmenite immediately and submit a report on the tender awarded by Lanka Mineral Sands Limited for the sale of 85,000 metric tons of ilmenite at USD 147 per ton to the third-place bidder instead of the buyer who had offered the highest price of USD 165 per ton of ilmenite.

    "text": "Uncompetitive practices 152. Public procurement also features a number of anti-competitive practices that give rise to severe corruption vulnerabilities. The default method for the award of contracts under the procurement Guidelines is use of competitive tenders but it is difficult to ascertain the extent of non- competitive selections, in the absence of comprehensive data. Integrity risks in the procurement process are particularly high when executing agencies elect to use non-competitive procedures, availing themselves of possible exemptions provided for in the PR (e.g., direct contracting to a pre- identified supplier or service provider, emergency procurement). Furthermore, the practice of accepting unsolicited proposals for large infrastructure projects (see above Public Investment Management) creates significant corruption risks due to the lack of transparency and competitiveness. Limited transparency 153. There is very limited transparency and oversight of procurement processes and outcomes. Timely availability of accurate, relevant, and complete procurement statistics is very limited. The absence of consolidated procurement plans, and a fully functioning e-procurement system contribute to this lack of data. The government has little information on the progress of procurement or the factors that cause its delays. There is also no information available to the public on the award of contracts. There appears to be an ad-hoc mechanism to publish information about defaulted suppliers/contractors. Lack of comprehensive rules for blacklisting was identified as a gap in Sri Lanka’s regulatory framework by World Bank, in 2003. 154. Inadequate procurement planning limits competition and transparency of the procurement processes. There is no consolidated procurement plan that would enhance the integration of procurement and budgeting. The NPC’s Annual Performance Report of 201974 indicates that many of the ministries and institutions do not follow a standard format for procurement plans and action plans and these documents were not always approved by the Chief Accounting Officer. There are frequent major amendments to the initial Action Plans and Procurement Plans throughout the year. It was also recognised that there is little monitoring of the compliance between procurements in the Procurement Plan with activities in the Action Plan, which creates opportunities for the institutions to misuse funds and make subjective decisions. 155. Although there have been some encouraging developments in the organization of public procurement, such as developing PROMISe, much remains to be done for competitive and well- regulated public procurement. The Procurement Management Information System (PROMISe) is being developed but is currently in a pilot phase. PROMISe has the potential to be a key tool for improving the integrity of public procurement by enabling better processing, tracking, recording, reporting, and publicising procurement actions and outcomes.

      "Uncompetitive practices 152. Public procurement also features a number of anti-competitive practices that give rise to severe corruption vulnerabilities. The default method for the award of contracts under the procurement Guidelines is use of competitive tenders but it is difficult to ascertain the extent of non- competitive selections, in the absence of comprehensive data. Integrity risks in the procurement process are particularly high when executing agencies elect to use non-competitive procedures, availing themselves of possible exemptions provided for in the PR (e.g., direct contracting to a pre- identified supplier or service provider, emergency procurement). Furthermore, the practice of accepting unsolicited proposals for large infrastructure projects (see above Public Investment Management) creates significant corruption risks due to the lack of transparency and competitiveness. Limited transparency 153. There is very limited transparency and oversight of procurement processes and outcomes. Timely availability of accurate, relevant, and complete procurement statistics is very limited. The absence of consolidated procurement plans, and a fully functioning e-procurement system contribute to this lack of data. The government has little information on the progress of procurement or the factors that cause its delays. There is also no information available to the public on the award of contracts. There appears to be an ad-hoc mechanism to publish information about defaulted suppliers/contractors. Lack of comprehensive rules for blacklisting was identified as a gap in Sri Lanka’s regulatory framework by World Bank, in 2003. 154. Inadequate procurement planning limits competition and transparency of the procurement processes. There is no consolidated procurement plan that would enhance the integration of procurement and budgeting. The NPC’s Annual Performance Report of 201974 indicates that many of the ministries and institutions do not follow a standard format for procurement plans and action plans and these documents were not always approved by the Chief Accounting Officer. There are frequent major amendments to the initial Action Plans and Procurement Plans throughout the year. It was also recognised that there is little monitoring of the compliance between procurements in the Procurement Plan with activities in the Action Plan, which creates opportunities for the institutions to misuse funds and make subjective decisions. 155. Although there have been some encouraging developments in the organization of public procurement, such as developing PROMISe, much remains to be done for competitive and well- regulated public procurement. The Procurement Management Information System (PROMISe) is being developed but is currently in a pilot phase. PROMISe has the potential to be a key tool for improving the integrity of public procurement by enabling better processing, tracking, recording, reporting, and publicising procurement actions and outcomes. However, its impact on addressing corruption vulnerabilities will depend on the manner in which it is deployed, the competencies of 74 Available at https://www.parliament.lk/uploads/documents/paperspresented/performance-report-national-procurement- commission-2019.pdf IMF | Technical Report – Sri Lanka Governance Diagnostic Assessment | 67"

Cash rationing is exacerbated by an absence of effective commitment control. Finance Regulations provide that no commitments shall be incurred unless financial provision exists in the Annual Estimates and all commitments must be recorded. However, these instructions are not followed by all spending units and, those that do, perform such task manually.

An effective internal control system is essential for creating an environment that ensures appropriate decision-making regarding the use of public resources, with clear accountability for such decisions, including via administrative structures, as well as external oversight by a supreme audit institution and the legislature. A continuous improvement approach to internal control should be promoted by having a reliable internal audit function that is a trusted source of advice to management. These internal control and accountability structures are essential for the prevention of corruption. 166. The internal control and audit function of the Government of Sri Lanka is governed by the Finance Regulations and the Audit Act. The Finance Regulations assign Chief Accounting Officers (who are the Secretaries of Ministries) and Accounting Officers (i.e., heads of departmentsdepartments) as being responsible for establishing an effective internal control environment (F.R.127 & 128), which includes the establishment of an internal audit unit in each department (F.R. 133). This requirement is reflected in the National Audit Act (No.18 of 2019), which specifies that the internal audit function reports to the Chief Accounting Officer (CAO), and be guided by an Audit and Management Committee, which also reports to the CAO. These requirements extend to ministries, provincial councils and public corporations. 167. A Department of Management Audit (DMA) is establishing within the MoF to guide the development of the internal audit function across government. The DMA has authority to issue circulars and guidelines to promote effective and consistent internal audit processes. The DMA advises that the types of audits performed include financial and performance audits as well as systems audits and special investigations. Existing information does not allow a determination of whether functioning internal audit units exist across government, or the competencies and capabilities of officials tasked with internal audit responsibilities. DMA receives a copy of all internal audit reports from across government, but the extent to which management reacts and addresses internal audit findings and recommendations is unclear. There is no publicly available information regarding either the internal audit reports or follow-up. The DMA has prepared a set of draft guidelines that reflect a modern risk- based approach to internal audit which seeks to promote improvements to internal control of the respective entity according to an agreed entity-specific audit charter. These guidelines should be formally issued by the DMA as soon as possible. IMF | Technical Report – Sri Lanka Governance Diagnostic Assessment | 72",

According to Article 152 of the Constitution, the Auditor-General (A-G) is appointed by the President and reports to the legislature. The A-G is responsible for the audit of all public entities, including ministries, departments, local government and public corporations. Audits are conducted according to Sri Lankan standards that are aligned with international standards, reports are tabled in the Parliament and published. Audit coverage of Public Corporations is an ongoing issue as less than one-half of public corporations submit their financial statements on time, and the A-G is blocked from accessing a number of subsidiary entities (which is the subject of ongoing legal action). 169. There are links between internal and external audit. The A-G receives a copy of all internal audit reports and is invited to observe meeting of the Audit and Management Committee of respective government entities. CAOs are required by law to identify remedial actions in response to the findings of a report by the A-G. The draft guidelines for internal audit instruct audit and management committees to follow-up that remedial actions have been taken, but there is no indication that current practices feature such actions. 170. There are common themes across the findings and recommendations of internal and external audit reports. The DMA reports that common findings of internal audits include weaknesses in cash management, contract management, revenue collection and procurement as well as deficiencies in the management of assets, including in relation to management of advances, physical assets and investment projects. These issues are also reflected in the findings contained within reports by the A-G which include: failure to follow procurement rules, assets not being identified and valued appropriately, weaknesses in contract management, potential conflicts of interest in the management of pension funds, as well as weaknesses in the oversight and governance of public corporations. 171. A key weakness of the existing internal control environment is that the findings of internal and external audit are repeated regularly. This indicates a failure of Accounting Officers and the MoF to create the changes in the internal control environment necessary to avoid re- occurrence of negative findings. As an example, the FMIS, which is a key element of the internal control environment, is not fully operational after 10 years of development (despite being an off-the-shelf solution), and the procedures, business processes and systems are not adequate to support the effective accounting for, and management of, government assets. There is an urgent need for the Treasury to develop an action plan with specific responses to addressing the most common adverse findings of internal and external audit reports. 172.

As discussed in section II, the Auditor-General could be provided with specific powers, and indeed a requirement to submit evidence of corrupt practice to law enforcement and/or anti-corruption entities with appropriate investigative authority. The recent expansion of the Auditor-General’s functions beyond financial audit and compliance to include performance matters is an important development. The Auditor-General could also be given an explicit mandate under the Audit Act to review PPPs. Expanding expectations for the Auditor-General would require corresponding increases in financing and building institutional competency to take on new tasks.

Moreover, a recent study by Advocata (a non-government think tank) found that only 52 regularly publish financial data, and of these only one had tabled its mandated annual report to Parliament in each of the last 5 years. The annual reports that are produced do not provide content required by the PED, and SOEs provide little information pertaining to access to information required by RTI. SOEs that are audited frequently receive a qualified audit, (or disclaimer).82 While the PED is understood to collate data from the SOEs, it publishes no consolidated data or analysis of SOE performance. 179. The legal framework provides representatives of line ministry, the MoF and political leaders with the ability to intervene in the day-to-day operations of SOEs. Part II of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 provides that each corporation’s budget must be approved by its board but that any capital expenditure in that budget above a value of 500,000 rupees must be approved by the minister responsible for Planning and the Minister of Finance as well as the respective shareholding Minister. In addition, in accordance with the Financial Regulations, during the execution of their budgets, SOEs are subject to government rules regarding procurement and are subject to internal controls over transactions which require ministry approval for recruitment and purchasing decisions. Managers of SOEs indicate there is a lack of clarity regarding whether they report to their governing board or their responsible shareholding minister and/or the ministry of finance. 180. There is evidence of the central government intervening inappropriately in the operation of SOEs. CSOs, media and audit reports, as well as interviews with SOE management, suggest that appointments to SOE boards are politically motivated, that there is political interference in staffing and recruitment decisions, that there are inappropriate (corrupt) interventions in SOE procurements processes. Facilities and services of SOEs are understood to have been used inappropriately for personal and political gain. Due to the nature of the legal framework, which is weak in relation to corporate governance yet provides for direct control by central government, there is little possibility of entities operating at arms-length from government to avoid these interventions. 181. The central Government has also imposed unfunded quasi-fiscal operations on SOEs which have impacted severely on their financial sustainability. Several of the largest SOEs, including those in the energy and petroleum sector, have operated at significant financial loss due to the government setting regulated prices at well below cost-recovery level. As a result, these entities are required to borrow from the Treasury or from state-owned banks, under protection of letter of support or guarantee from the Treasury, to provide a minimum level of liquidity. The largest SOEs have not been able to provide financial returns to the government in the form of dividends and have also accumulated large payment arrears to suppliers, including other SOEs. Recent reforms, supported by the EFF, to have cost-reflective pricing in energy and petroleum SOEs is a step in the right direction which needs to be reflective in policies applied across SOEs. 182. The corollary to the inappropriate operational and financial intervention in SOEs by the central government is a major deficiency in SOE transparency and accountability. While the central government is required to approval SOE budgets, they do not analyse the planned performance 82 Advocata Research Institute, 2022, The State of State-Owned Enterprises 2022.

The legal framework provides representatives of line ministry, the MoF and political leaders with the ability to intervene in the day-to-day operations of SOEs. Part II of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 provides that each corporation’s budget must be approved by its board but that any capital expenditure in that budget above a value of 500,000 rupees must be approved by the minister responsible for Planning and the Minister of Finance as well as the respective shareholding Minister. In addition, in accordance with the Financial Regulations, during the execution of their budgets, SOEs are subject to government rules regarding procurement and are subject to internal controls over transactions which require ministry approval for recruitment and purchasing decisions. Managers of SOEs indicate there is a lack of clarity regarding whether they report to their governing board or their responsible shareholding minister and/or the ministry of finance. 180. There is evidence of the central government intervening inappropriately in the operation of SOEs. CSOs, media and audit reports, as well as interviews with SOE management, suggest that appointments to SOE boards are politically motivated, that there is political interference in staffing and recruitment decisions, that there are inappropriate (corrupt) interventions in SOE procurements processes. Facilities and services of SOEs are understood to have been used inappropriately for personal and political gain. Due to the nature of the legal framework, which is weak in relation to corporate governance yet provides for direct control by central government, there is little possibility of entities operating at arms-length from government to avoid these interventions. 181. The central Government has also imposed unfunded quasi-fiscal operations on SOEs which have impacted severely on their financial sustainability. Several of the largest SOEs, including those in the energy and petroleum sector, have operated at significant financial loss due to the government setting regulated prices at well below cost-recovery level. As a result, these entities are required to borrow from the Treasury or from state-owned banks, under protection of letter of support or guarantee from the Treasury, to provide a minimum level of liquidity. The largest SOEs have not been able to provide financial returns to the government in the form of dividends and have also accumulated large payment arrears to suppliers, including other SOEs. Recent reforms, supported by the EFF, to have cost-reflective pricing in energy and petroleum SOEs is a step in the right direction which needs to be reflective in policies applied across SOEs. 182. The corollary to the inappropriate operational and financial intervention in SOEs by the central government is a major deficiency in SOE transparency and accountability. While the central government is required to approval SOE budgets, they do not analyse the planned performance 82 Advocata Research Institute, 2022, The State of State-Owned Enterprises 2022.

On average, Asia-Pacific countries reach 60 percent of their tax capacity, if Sri Lanka were to achieve that level, a revenue ratio to GDP of 13 percent would be reached. 85 This may bring more revenue if the final tax obligation exceeds the withheld amount, but it also poses challenges for IRD, which has no systems in place to pay refunds.

Withholding taxation of several income types has been made non-final,85 and new indirect taxes have been introduced (such as the Social Security Levy – a substitute for the Nation Building Tax) or increased (such as on betting and gaming or an 84 The ratio is also low compared to estimates of Sri Lanka’s tax capacity—a measure of how much a country with similar conditions, such as income levels, could raise. Fenochietto and Pessino (2013) estimate Sri Lanka’s tax capacity at 22 percent of GDP, suggesting that there is much room for revenue increases. On average, Asia-Pacific countries reach 60 percent of their tax capacity, if Sri Lanka were to achieve that level, a revenue ratio to GDP of 13 percent would be reached. 85 This may bring more revenue if the final tax obligation exceeds the withheld amount, but it also poses challenges for IRD, which has no systems in place to pay refunds.

Processes to Change Tax System Parameters The tax system can be changed in two ways: law amendments (including the drafting of new Acts) and the updating of regulations (Ordinances or Gazette notifications). While the DoFP is in most cases an integral component in the formulation of amendments, there is less consistency and oversight in tax law change through Gazette notifications. Notably, there is no standardised process that ensures the revenue implications of tax law changes are consistently evaluated. Whether a given provisions can be updated through regulations is typically specified in the underlying Act. Law amendments, which typically take several months, usually (but not always) go through the following phases: 1. Quality control: Once a tax law change has been proposed, either by a government department, business chambers, or the public, the proposal is evaluated by DoFP and IRD in consultation with all other government agencies involved in the design and administration of taxes (such as the Board of Investment). The proposal is then shared with the Treasury Secretary and his advisors. 2. Legal drafting process: If both the Minister and the Cabinet approve, the drafting of the legal provisions begins. A first draft is prepared by divisions within DoFP and IRD, which is then shared with the legal draftsmen department in the Ministry of Justice. Once the legal draftsmen have finalised a first draft, the Bill is then sent back to DoFP for final clearance and if approved, passed on to the Attorney General for constitutional clearance. 3. Enactment: Once all clearances have been received, the new provision needs to be approved by the Cabinet upon which the Bill is published in the official Gazette. After 7 days from the publication in the Gazette and on request of the Minister, the Bill is presented to Parliament. If approved by Parliament (possibly with amendments), the Bill then becomes an Act upon endorsement of the Speaker on the Bill. The process for updating regulations is much shorter: after an Ordinance is signed by the Minister, it becomes law upon publication in the Gazette. Depending on the Act, the Gazette notification is then presented to Parliament within a specified period, or as soon as convenient. Crucially, the first phase of quality control, where the tax law change is discussed between various departments, is not part of this process. Box 7.

Enactment: Once all clearances have been received, the new provision needs to be approved by the Cabinet upon which the Bill is published in the official Gazette. After 7 days from the publication in the Gazette and on request of the Minister, the Bill is presented to Parliament. If approved by Parliament (possibly with amendments), the Bill then becomes an Act upon endorsement of the Speaker on the Bill. The process for updating regulations is much shorter: after an Ordinance is signed by the Minister, it becomes law upon publication in the Gazette. Depending on the Act, the Gazette notification is then presented to Parliament within a specified period, or as soon as convenient. Crucially, the first phase of quality control, where the tax law change is discussed between various departments, is not part of this process. Box 7.

While the DoFP is in most cases an integral component in the formulation of amendments, there is less consistency and oversight in tax law change through 199. Sri Lanka has made commendable progress in unifying the tax treatment of most Gazette notifications. Notably, there is no standardized process that ensures the revenue implications of tax law companies. Until 2022, the tax system was fragmented by a multiplicity of sectoral exemptions and changes are consistently evaluated. Whether a given provisions can be updated through regulations is typically reduced rates that applied to different activities. These differences likely contributed to a misallocation specified in the underlying Act. of resLoawu racmese,n adsm ceanptsi,t walh iacnh dty lpaicbaollry wtaakes saetvteraraclt medo nttoh ss, eucstuoarllsy a(bnudt naoctt iavlwitiaeyss ) wgiot hth lroowug tha txhaet ifoolnlo rwaitnhge prh tahsaesn: with high productivity.

Tax expenditure (exemptions, tax holidays, concessions) management is fragmented, prone to misuse, with little, if any oversight. While IRD advise that they are duly informed of exemptions approved by the MoF, the MoF has advised that all exemptions are communicated to the IRD via the Board of Investment (BoI) and gazette publishing suggesting there is no clarity or process for information. IRD has no apparent system to record and track exemptions, per se, other than within individual taxpayer files. As such there is currently no way to quantify exemptions, have consistent approaches, and ensure that they are permitted according to the parameters they were granted (i.e., what are the expiry dates, what do concessions apply to, who is entitled to get them). Furthermore, there are revenue and corruption vulnerabilities for businesses with a mix of concessional and non- concessional operations. Some BoI approved firms may sell up to 20 percent of their production into the local market but subject to non-concessional tax treatment (VAT, CIT on portion of profits attributed to local sales). 215. Effective fiscal analysis and tax policy formulation is undermined by unnecessary restrictions (unjustly determined by IRD) on the sharing of anonymised taxpayer data by IRD with the MoF Fiscal Policy Department. Evidence-based monitoring of the outcomes resulting from the implementation of tax policy measures is macro-critical to ensure delivery of the revenue-driven fiscal adjustment commitments under the EFF. The ability to fine-tune and adjust tax policies in response to changing economic circumstances is predicated on reliable and timely taxpayer data. Furthermore, MoF oversight of IRD performance is essential to monitor revenue and compliance outcomes to identify causes of revenue leakage including from integrity vulnerabilities. IRD should be fully engaged in fiscal forecasting. Section 100 of the Inland Revenue Act 2017 mandates strict secrecy provisions in the administration of taxpayer data, but s. 100(b) empowers the Minister of Finance to grant these powers within the MoF in the supervision of the IRD that would be further safeguarded through the anonymization of any taxpayer-specific information for analytical purposes.91 216. The working relationship between the Fiscal Policy Department and IRD has broken down and become dysfunctional. As noted, Inland Revenue has been reluctant to share vitally needed tax data with the MoF that can be readily overcome. While primacy for formulation of tax policy rightly resides in the MoF, it should not be developed unilaterally but should benefit from the input and views of the revenue departments who ultimately must administratively implement the policies. They are best placed to explain the administrative and compliance challenges that may be encountered by any new or changed policy. Revenue forecasting similarly should be developed with inputs from the revenue departments to take account of their knowledge of taxpayer compliance in 91 S100: “(…) every person having a duty under this Act or being employed in the administration of this Act, shall regard as secret and confidential all information and documents the person has received in an official capacity in relation to a specific taxpayer, and may disclose that information only to the following persons:- (a) the employees of the Department and of the Customs Department in the course, and for the purpose, of carrying out their duties; (b) the Minister in charge of the subject of Finance in the course, and for the purpose, of carrying out supervision of the Department (…)”.

The current outdated legal framework, the Monetary Law Act (the MLA), was reformed through a Bill of amendments approved by Parliament in July 2023.

While these factors were not direct enablers of corruption, their absence weakened the governance safeguards in this area. Furthermore, the CBSL mandate, which included a development objective without priority to price stability, could have engaged the central bank in non-core operations. Attempts to reform the MLA were made in 2019, with technical assistance from Fund staff but were not enacted owing to the lack of political support at the time. The CBSL Act now strengthens the CBSL mandate with primacy given to price stability, the bank’s autonomy, governance framework, as well as its accountability requirements. 219.

To this end, the Governing Board should have requisite collective expertise on matters related to their mandate, including finance, economics, risk management, financial reporting, legal, and information technology. 223. To support quality governance practices at the Board, the CBSL should align their secondary legal documents to the CBSL Act. The Board and the committees’ charters would need to be updated or developed (as needed).

Except for the license of Bank of China in 2017, no new licence has been granted in the last ten years. Although several requests to set-up banks/branches were evaluated, they were not considered favorably having regard to the interest of the national economy, including, and the banking needs of Sri Lanka. The banking sector comprises 24 Licensed Commercial Banks96 (LCBs) and 6 Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs).97 The two largest commercial banks are state- owned, they represent 36.1% of the assets of the banking sector and are considered as Domestic Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs). 234. The State also has indirect influence in banks and other financial institutions given the substantial portfolios of state-managed funds, including the Employee Providence Fund (EPF), or the Employee Trust Fund (ETF), or the state-owned Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation.98 This is the case for the two largest private banks, considered as DSIBs. The largest privately-owned commercial bank, representing 12.5% of the assets of the banking sector, has almost 19% of state- related ownership. The second largest privately-owned bank, representing 9% of the assets of the banking sector, has almost 26% of state-related ownership.99 235. While the CBSL has made efforts to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory frameworks, the non-performing loans (NPLs) have risen since 2019. Since the mid-2010s, the CBSL increased and upgraded capital and liquidity requirements based closely on the Basel III standards, implemented the International Financial Reporting Standard 9, and enhanced some supervisory elements moving towards a risk-based approach. However, in the recent years, the banking sector operated under challenging business conditions commencing from the Easter attacks in 2019, continuing with the COVID-19 pandemic and the adverse macro-economic factors in 2022. With the deterioration in credit quality, the banking sector had to continue to implement moratoriums and concessions to affected borrowers, while operating with tight liquidity and capital buffers. Growth in assets and liabilities during 2022 was mainly due to the translation of foreign currency (FCY) denominated assets and liabilities into LKR with the depreciation of exchange rate. 95 The non-bank sector consists mainly of deposit-taking finance companies, pension funds, and insurance companies. Other financial institutions, such as leasing companies, microfinance institutions, stockbrokers and fund managers, and venture capital firms, are small and do not play a significant role in financial intermediation. 96 In addition to the two large state-owned banks, there are 11 privately-owned domestic banks and 11 branches of foreign banks. 97 LSBs are licensed under the Banking Act, are regulated, and supervised similarly to LCBs, they are not permitted to take demand deposits or undertake foreign currency business. Two are 100% state-owned savings banks (the smallest one is in the process of being absorbed by the largest one), one is 100% state-owned development bank, one is a 100% state-owned mortgage bank, and one is a 51% state-owned housing bank. Except for the largest savings bank that is considered as a DSIB and represents around 8% of the assets of the banking sector, none of them represent more of 1% of the assets of the banking sector. 98 The authorities have indicated that they do not agree with the characterization of indirect influence of the state due to the portfolio of the EPF, based on extensive regulatory provisions on the management of the fund. 99 Three others have state-related ownership between 32.5% and 26.5% and represent between 4.3% and 2.9% of the banking sector assets.

The Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI) comprised 36 License Finance Companies (LFCs) licensed under the Finance Business Act No 42 of 2011 and one Specialised Leasing Company (SLC) licensed under the Finance Leasing Act No 56 of 2000. They are only permitted to take savings and fixed term deposits and represent 5.2% of the total assets of the financial sector, with finance leases representing 41.6% of the total loans and advances. Most banks owned a LFC. Although the regulatory and supervisory frameworks for LFCs were strengthened, it remains lighter than those for banks and the performance of the LFCs has been weaker than that of banks. Since 2020, following the announcement of a Masterplan for the LFCs/SLCs with the objective to build a resilient and well- performing sector of 25 LFCs, the Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institution (DSNBFI) has cancelled several LFC licences or encouraged through moral suasion the amalgamation of several LFCs. 237. There are specific risks and challenges for banks and other non-bank financial institutions with Government ownership, including excessive lending to SOEs, some of them being insolvent. In Sri-Lanka a large share of the financial sector is under public ownership. In addition to direct ownership in financial institutions, the weight of the portfolio of the EPF, ETF, and the state- owned insurance company across the commercial banking system can be a force for indirectely shaping behavior.100 State-owned financial institutions are often exposed to increased risk of political influence over their operations. In Sri Lanka, while the state-owned banks are in principle subject to the same laws and regulations as the other commercial banks, some provisions may suggest otherwise.101 As some vulnerabilities could be associated with board nominations, it should be noted that the annual reports published on the website of the banks with state-related ownership do not provide much information on the role of the state-related shareholders in the nomination of directors in those banks.

      "236. The Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI) comprised 36 License Finance Companies (LFCs) licensed under the Finance Business Act No 42 of 2011 and one Specialised Leasing Company (SLC) licensed under the Finance Leasing Act No 56 of 2000. They are only permitted to take savings and fixed term deposits and represent 5.2% of the total assets of the financial sector, with finance leases representing 41.6% of the total loans and advances. Most banks owned a LFC. Although the regulatory and supervisory frameworks for LFCs were strengthened, it remains lighter than those for banks and the performance of the LFCs has been weaker than that of banks. Since 2020, following the announcement of a Masterplan for the LFCs/SLCs with the objective to build a resilient and well- performing sector of 25 LFCs, the Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institution (DSNBFI) has cancelled several LFC licences or encouraged through moral suasion the amalgamation of several LFCs. 237. There are specific risks and challenges for banks and other non-bank financial institutions with Government ownership, including excessive lending to SOEs, some of them being insolvent. In Sri-Lanka a large share of the financial sector is under public ownership. In addition to direct ownership in financial institutions, the weight of the portfolio of the EPF, ETF, and the state- owned insurance company across the commercial banking system can be a force for indirectely shaping behavior.100 State-owned financial institutions are often exposed to increased risk of political influence over their operations. In Sri Lanka, while the state-owned banks are in principle subject to the same laws and regulations as the other commercial banks, some provisions may suggest otherwise.101 As some vulnerabilities could be associated with board nominations, it should be noted that the annual reports published on the website of the banks with state-related ownership do not provide much information on the role of the state-related shareholders in the nomination of directors in those banks. In addition, it should be noted that the banking expertise and experience of SOB Boards and executive management varies widely.102 238. To promote the safety and soundness of banks and Non-Bank Financial Institutions with Government ownership and reduce potential exposure to illegitimate business practices, banking supervisory processes should be strengthened following international good practices in supervising public banks as highlighted in the IMF Paper.

The fundamental revision of Banking Act should be an occasion to harmonise the regulatory and supervisory requirements for banks and non-bank deposit-taking financial institutions.110 Currently, there are different sets of regulations for each type of financial institution. For instance, while the regulatory and supervisory framework for commercial banks and specialised banks are similar, they require the CBSL to issues different set of directions and circulars for each type of bank.111 Similarly, since banks and LFCs conduct similar type of operations they should be subject to similar regulatory and supervisory requirements. Not only, this will avoid the possibility of regulatory arbitrage, but it will ensure an adequate level-playing field between financial institutions. Considering that larger and more sophisticated financial institutions should be subject to tighter regulatory and supervisory requirements, that could be achieved by adopting some proportionality in the regulation of non-bank deposit taking to cater to their simpler business models and smaller size and considering the size, complexity, risk profile and business model of each financial institution. 243. For several years the CBSL has been evolving towards a more risk-based supervision approach of banks. Following implementation of Pillars 2 and 3 of the Basel frameworks, the CBSL decided to implement a Supervisory Review Process (SRP) to assess each year the capital adequacy of the banks through the review of the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) that each bank needs to produce on an annual basis. To support the work of the supervisors, the Banking Supervision Department (BSD) has developed an Operation Manual, to be updated on an annual basis, covering the role and responsibilities of the BSD divisions, in particular the Continuous Supervision Division (i.e., Off-site function) and the Examination Division (i.e, On-Site function). Each bank has a focus point within the CSD who has the responsibility to review the prudential returns produced by the banks and identify the supervisory risks using risk profile indicators primarily based on a CAMEL framework.112 Based on the BSD manual, it is the Examination Division that uses the BSRI (Bank Sustainability Rating Index), the in-house risk assessment tool developed by the CBSL to assign supervisory ratings to the banks based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative indicators. Based on the overall BSRI, the Examination Division will decide the scope and frequency of the on-site examination and establishes an Annual Examination Plan. 244.

The organization of the BSD seems relatively complex to achieve the objective of implementing a Risk-Based Supervision (RBS) approach.

This organization aims to provide more diversity in the role of each of the Deputy Directors but organizational complexity may hamper effective RBS. 115 While there is no preferred model to organise supervisory activities, it could be considered for more effective supervision to group the banks in clusters of banks with similar risk profiles (DSIBs, State-Owned, medium private, small private, Islamic, foreign, etc.) given the shortage in experienced staff.

It is often observed that when institutions fail, the root cause of the problem was weaknesses in corporate governance, including inadequate oversight of the financial institution and of their subsidiaries by the board of directors. The absence of sufficient Board oversight has enabled management to take excessive and imprudent risks. It is essential that the board is empowered to set the bank’s strategy, objectives, and overall direction, and that senior management is accountable to the board for the day- to-day running of the institution and their NBFI subsidiaries. The oversight roles include reviewing the performance of the management and the achievement of its objectives and monitoring and ensuring the integrity of financial information as well as the soundness and effectiveness of the risk management and internal controls of the bank and their NBFI subsidiaries. 251. However, the CBSL would benefit from reviewing the corporate governance framework to ensure that it contains the key elements of the Basel Principles for effective corporate governance for banks issued in 2015.118 The corporate governance framework for financial institutions should be aligned with those principles, through key provisions in the Banking Act and amending secondary legislation, with a specific focus on board qualification, 119 composition and selection, risk governance and culture, independence of directors, implementation of the three lines of control model. The CBSL issued, in application to Section 46 of the Banking Act 1988, the Corporate Governance Directions No 11 of 2007 for LCBs and No 12 of 2007 for LSBs, prior to the issuance of the Basel Corporate Governance Principles for Banks 2015. The current provisions cover many aspects of governance, such as the responsibilities, composition and committees of the board, the fit and proper criteria, and disclosures. However, despite those directions having been amended several times, they do not include many important principles set by the Basel Committee, such as the three lines of controls/defence model with the independence of the three control functions (risk management, compliance, and internal audit). In fact, while the Corporate Governance regulatory framework for banks has not been aligned with the 2015 Basel Principles, the Direction No 5 of 31 December 2021 under the Finance Business Act No 42 of 2011 for NBFI incorporates more of those 2015 Basel principles. While licensing criteria may differ depending on the activities and lines of business of the financial institutions, corporate governance arrangements should be similar for LCBs, LSBs, or NBFI, independently of the type of their activities. Since the CBSL is recommended to review the corporate governance framework for banks, it should consider harmonizing the different provisions. The CBSL should also consider the principle of proportionality to ensure that governance arrangements are commensurate and consistent with the size, complexity and individual risk profile and business model of the bank or financial institution. 120 In the course of the supervisory work, either from an off-site (continuous supervision) or on-site perspective, the CBSL 118 See the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Guidelines “Corporate Governance Principles for Banks” published at https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d328.pdf 119 The authorities indicated that provision on qualification would be strengthened in the amendments to the Banking Act as follows: \"that such person possesses academic or professional qualifications, and effective experience in banking, finance, economics, accounting, business administration, information technology, risk management, law or any other relevant discipline, as may be determined by the Central Bank\". 120 The authorities indicated that with the successful completion of NBFI sector masterplan, NBFI sector will comprise of large and stable LFCs and that the proposed amendments to the Banking Act may include principles on proportionality.

Currently in Sri Lanka boards should not have less than 7 and more than 13 directors. As a result, the largest state-banks have in theory 7 directors, when tiniest banks have sometimes 13. Reading through the Annual Reports published by the banks on their website, directors are spread into too many committees, which may question their capacity to allocate enough time to their responsibilities. 121 252. The CBSL should monitor the process of appointment of directors and ensure that banks and other financial institutions have succession planning for both directors and management, including the heads of the control functions.122 Except for unavoidable circumstances, since the end of the mandates of members of the board and key management personnel is known well in advance, the CBSL should ensure that due diligences are completed in due time by banks and other financial institutions and there is no vacancy in the boards.123 253. One important 2015 BCBS principle is related to the role of supervisors in the guidance to be provided to financial institutions to ensure that banks and other financial institutions have robust corporate governance policies and practices. Therefore, in addition to the Corporate Governance directions, the CBSL should issue guidelines to provide clarification on some notions, to be considered both at the time of the nomination process but also when assessing the individual and collective suitability and performance of the directors. In that regard, guidance should be provided not only on time commitment, adequate individual and collective knowledge, diversity in skills and experience, but also on notions such as honesty, integrity, and independence of mind. Guidelines would help to establish harmonised criteria for the assessment of suitability of individual directors and overall boards but also of Key Management Personnel (KMP). Beyond providing guidance on expectations, the CBSL could share good practices observed in the banks and other financial institutions they supervised. For instance, it was observed that one bank has decided that even their major shareholders will not nominate directors, but that directors would be proposed to the Annual General Meeting by a Nomination Committee responsible for ensuring that the above-mentioned criteria (diversity in skills, knowledge, time commitment, etc.) are satisfied. 254. The fitness and propriety process used by the CBSL to review the affidavits appears relatively formal and should be focusing on qualitative reviews of the elements provided by the applicant from a risk-based analysis. In application to Section 12 (1B) of the Banking Act 1988, when granting approval for an acquisition of a material interest of a licensed bank to an individual or a corporate body, the Monetary Board must determine whether the individual or the directors of such corporate body are fit and proper persons considering the criteria set out in Section 42 of the Banking Act (mostly academic or professional expertise, experience, absence of finding of fraud, dishonesty, 121 While mandatory requirement is only four Board Sub-committees (i.e., Risk, Audit, Nominations, and Human Resources & Remuneration), some banks have additional committees. 122 The authorities indicated that the adequacy of succession planning procedures for senior management, including for the heads of control functions, is reviewed by the on-site examinations in line with the applicable Corporate Governance Directions. However, given the prevailing market conditions, implementation of such procedures at times is challenging. 123 At the time of Governance Diagnostic Assessment, it was observed that some of the largest state-owned financial institutions had only 2 or 3 directors for months, due to the delay in submitting names and proper documental by the banks for fit and proper assessment by the CBSL, with boards seats of the banks left unattended for extended periods of time.

Since strong senior managers in financial institutions can help to safeguard the integrity of the financial sector and minimise opportunities for corruption, the fit and proper framework for assessing the suitability of members of the board of directors, CEOs and KMPs needs to be strengthened to be more aligned with international standards.

Section 3(1) xvi of Directions No 11 of 2007 for LCBs and No 12 of 2007 for LSBs require the board to publish in the bank annual report a corporate governance report setting out the compliance with the Corporate Governance Directions. Banks publish in their Annual Report an assessment showing that they “comply” with the requirements of the Direction. To comply with the CBSL requirements, banks put a lot of efforts in providing detailed information on the board composition, the board committees, as well as the biographies and activities of their directors and senior management. As a result of those detailed and lengthy descriptions of the formal compliance of the banks with the regulatory requirements of the CBSL, it is relatively difficult to find in the annual reports essential information, such as information on the shareholders. Rather than focusing on detailed information in the Annual Report, the CBSL should adopt a more risk-based approach of the corporate governance information published in the annual report with more emphasis on the qualitative rather than the quantitative aspects of corporate governance, such as the Board assessment of its collective and individual contribution to the oversight of the bank, its management, and its risks. 256. In addition to developing guidelines for the financial institutions, the CBSL needs to provide to the supervisors a methodology to conduct comprehensive assessments of the corporate governance framework and practices in a financial institution. The checks done during on-site examinations, or the fit and proper assessment, are mostly on formality and compliance issues not on the substance to achieve a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of the board in the oversight of the management. 124 Such assessments should not only be done during on-site examination, but also from an off-site perspective through appropriate questionnaire and returns. Since the review of the compliance, as stated in the annual report of the financial institution, cannot be considered as adequate, the CBSL should develop a comprehensive methodology following the structure of the Basel Principles 2015 with specific guidance for each topic, describing the objective of the assessment, the issues that the supervisor may come across, providing detailed assessment template with potential observation or conclusion to be drawn from the findings. In addition to that guidance, the CBSL need to build capacity to conduct these assessments with supervisors developing an expertise in this area. 124 While no evidence was provided to the mission, the authorities indicated that many qualitative factors are considered in assessing the fitness and propriety of directors and that additional checks are carried out referring to other relevant regulators on an annual basis or when the need arises.

Therefore, in reality this process of enforcement often gets delayed, which limits the impact of court orders. 275. There is a clear lack of adequate staff to assist in the court administration and judicial research, especially in the Commercial High Court. Workload in the Commercial Court is high as this court handles Intellectual Property issues, commercial and company matters with a value over 50mLKA in addition to handling arbitration. Much of the commercial litigation needs to be conducted in English and therefore requires competent staff who can handle matters in English. Currently, there are only 3 research assistants for all 4 courts/judges (1 roll court and 3 trial). Caseload is heavy at the commercial court and there is significant backlog; the majority of cases are older than 5 years. Table 24.

It takes on average 6-7 years to enforce a contract in Sri Lanka and severe delays are the norm.139 A 2014 national survey of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) highlighted court delays, procedure, and corruption as “extremely serious” and impact Sri Lanka’s attractiveness to foreign direct investment.

      "Colombo, and they often have to travel long distances to execute the order (as the defendants are often not residents of Colombo). Therefore, in reality this process of enforcement often gets delayed, which limits the impact of court orders. 275. There is a clear lack of adequate staff to assist in the court administration and judicial research, especially in the Commercial High Court. Workload in the Commercial Court is high as this court handles Intellectual Property issues, commercial and company matters with a value over 50mLKA in addition to handling arbitration. Much of the commercial litigation needs to be conducted in English and therefore requires competent staff who can handle matters in English. Currently, there are only 3 research assistants for all 4 courts/judges (1 roll court and 3 trial). Caseload is heavy at the commercial court and there is significant backlog; the majority of cases are older than 5 years. Table 24.

The judiciary has taken steps to try and streamline the court process. Seventy percent of the cases filed in District Court are small claims (<1.5m Rp). The Small Claims Act provides for specific timeliness where the time from the defendant coming to court to when the case is concluded should not exceed 18 months. Sri Lanka has also introduced a pre-trial procedure of 2017 as an amendment to the Civil Procedure Act providing for specific timeliness (3 weeks to fix pre-trial, 2 months for the pre-trial and 4 months to finish the pre-trial) with a separate court for pre-trial with a dedicated pre- trial judge.144 The pre-trial procedures attempt to incorporate alternative dispute resolution into court proceedings and encourage early settlement of cases. However, the pre-trial procedure is currently not very effective as lawyers must only file their admissions and issues in writing, and there is a lack of serious motive at the pre-trial stage to attempt to reach early settlement.

Limitations relate both to capacity and the existence of established systems for recording and maintaining data, as well as protocols for data analysis and reporting. 289. There is limited publicly available and verifiable court statistics to inform decision making. Although some data is collected quarterly by the MoJ from various courts (such as case load, case type at a high level) and used to prepare progress and performance reports tabled in Parliament,147 the data collected is sparse and interpretation of this data has currently limited use for analysis in evaluating bottlenecks, efficiency gains or in wider policy making. There is currently no breakdown of data by category of types of cases and hard data on clearance rates, case turnover ratio and other valuable data to allow for identification of causes for delays in commercial cases. For example, while each court maintains a record of court order executions, there is currently no centralised database where all the information can be collated and analysed for performance metrics. In general, access to information is limited of legal information as it is currently dispersed and not widely accessible in a useable format to help advance the legal literacy of the general public. D. Enforcement of property rights 290. Enforcement of property rights is weak in Sri Lanka and the land administration system gives rise to multiple vulnerabilities to corruption. Reports have consistently found that access to land, and in particular access to State land, is among the key challenges in improving Sri Lanka’s competitiveness. These challenges include the dual system of land titling and registration resulting in a complex and opaque system open to land grabbing and uncertainty. Issues with the functioning of the system are further exacerbated by a cumbersome legal and institutional landscape for granting approvals for land for investment projects. The process of obtaining permits and grants is also an overly cumbersome and non-transparent process with approvals taking on average 18 months which has a negative impact on Sri Lanka’s appeal for investment.148 The key weaknesses in enforcement of property rights are as follows: a) Unclear Land policy with overly complicated legislation and institutional fragmentation of land administration present barriers in the enforcement of property rights. 291.

      "288. The JSC is largely unable to collect and analyse data on the performance of the sector or on individual performance. Limitations relate both to capacity and the existence of established systems for recording and maintaining data, as well as protocols for data analysis and reporting. 289. There is limited publicly available and verifiable court statistics to inform decision making. Although some data is collected quarterly by the MoJ from various courts (such as case load, case type at a high level) and used to prepare progress and performance reports tabled in Parliament,147 the data collected is sparse and interpretation of this data has currently limited use for analysis in evaluating bottlenecks, efficiency gains or in wider policy making. There is currently no breakdown of data by category of types of cases and hard data on clearance rates, case turnover ratio and other valuable data to allow for identification of causes for delays in commercial cases. For example, while each court maintains a record of court order executions, there is currently no centralised database where all the information can be collated and analysed for performance metrics. In general, access to information is limited of legal information as it is currently dispersed and not widely accessible in a useable format to help advance the legal literacy of the general public. D. Enforcement of property rights 290. Enforcement of property rights is weak in Sri Lanka and the land administration system gives rise to multiple vulnerabilities to corruption. Reports have consistently found that access to land, and in particular access to State land, is among the key challenges in improving Sri Lanka’s competitiveness. These challenges include the dual system of land titling and registration resulting in a complex and opaque system open to land grabbing and uncertainty. Issues with the functioning of the system are further exacerbated by a cumbersome legal and institutional landscape for granting approvals for land for investment projects. The process of obtaining permits and grants is also an overly cumbersome and non-transparent process with approvals taking on average 18 months which has a negative impact on Sri Lanka’s appeal for investment.148 The key weaknesses in enforcement of property rights are as follows: a) Unclear Land policy with overly complicated legislation and institutional fragmentation of land administration present barriers in the enforcement of property rights. 291. There is a lack of clear and decisive land policy with multiple agencies responsible for certain aspects of the land administration process governed by their own acts and regulations (see Table 24). The Ministry of Tourism and Land plays a key role along with the Land Commissioner’s General Department, Land Title Settlement Department, Survey Department, Land Use and Policy Planning department and Land Reforms Commission.

However, there are multiple deficiencies – one being that registration of deeds does not actually prove title to the land. Therefore, registration is not accepted as evidence for collateral purposes by reputable financial institutions who would require title reports attested by an accredited lawyer.

She further noted the fact that the Attorney General acting as representative of the State, creates the impression that the Attorney General represents the Government’s interests foremost and not the public interests. This in turn undermines the independence and credibility of the prosecution, particularly in politically sensitive cases.169 The Attorney General’s Department in Sri Lanka has been seen by some as a means by which the incumbent government has exerted pressure on the justice system, due to the fact that the Attorney General’s Department comes within the direct control of the Executive.170 More recently (2019), studies that have been carried out into the need to introduce a Public Prosecutor’s Office to Sri Lanka have highlighted the fact that the establishment of such an office 166 Palitha Fernando P.C., Former Attorney General “The Role Of The Attorney General Of Sri Lanka And The Rule Of Law; With Special Reference To The Criminal Justice System”, (2016) Oration Delivered at the 3rd Death Anniversary of the Late Mr. C.

This in turn undermines the independence and credibility of the prosecution, particularly in politically sensitive cases.169 The Attorney General’s Department in Sri Lanka has been seen by some as a means by which the incumbent government has exerted pressure on the justice system, due to the fact that the Attorney General’s Department comes within the direct control of the Executive.170 More recently (2019), studies that have been carried out into the need to introduce a Public Prosecutor’s Office to Sri Lanka have highlighted the fact that the establishment of such an office 166 Palitha Fernando P.C., Former Attorney General “The Role Of The Attorney General Of Sri Lanka And The Rule Of Law; With Special Reference To The Criminal Justice System”, (2016) Oration Delivered at the 3rd Death Anniversary of the Late Mr. C.

    "text": "The way forward for Sri Lanka? When considering whether Sri Lanka needs to have an independent Public Prosecutor’s Office, it is important to note that Sri Lanka did have an office of a Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), created under the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill in 1972. However, this was not an ‘independent authority’ but functioned instead as a delegated entity under the Attorney General.186 The DPP was accountable to both the Attorney General and Ministry of Justice. The Supreme Court was also empowered by writ to direct the Director of Public Prosecutions to act. However, this office was abolished in 1978 after it came under direct political pressure.187 The wide prosecutorial discretion vested with the Attorney General’s Department can easily become subject to political interference, due to the nature of its close political association. It is in this light, that – even if a national prosecution service was not created – the AG’s discretion must be structured and exercised subject to pre-determined and established criteria. The structuring of the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General through clearly established guidelines regarding the institution, maintaining and withdrawing of cases could resolve many of the issues highlighted in this Annex, mainly political interference and issues pertaining to the administration of justice. This would be in keeping with the spirit of the IAP guidelines mentioned at the beginning of this Annex. As mentioned previously, the Crown Prosecution Service of England & Wales, while looking into cases that have been investigated by the police and other investigative mechanisms, remains independent of the police and government. It functions through the establishment of detailed guidelines on a wide variety of aspects related to prosecution, primarily captured in the “Code for Crown Prosecutors”188 – a document mentioned earlier in this report. The guidelines attempt to provide objective criteria, focusing on independence and fairness. For example, the Code prescribes the “Full Code Test” or in the alternative the “Threshold Test” for the prosecution of crimes by the Crown. The manner and criteria for the disposals of cases are also clearly identified and defined, ensuring the independence and impartiality of the Service. In summary, the current situation in Sri Lanka is highly problematic, given the lack of clarity concerning essential investigative and prosecutorial processes, in particular the opacity of the relationship between CIABOC and the Attorney General’s Department. CIABOC is the centrepiece of the new Anti- Corruption Act of 2023 and will be central to the effort to disrupt corrupt practices in Sri Lanka. But that will only succeed if there is meaningful clarity of its functional relationships with other government bodies, in particular the Attorney General’s Department.

      "The way forward for Sri Lanka? When considering whether Sri Lanka needs to have an independent Public Prosecutor’s Office, it is important to note that Sri Lanka did have an office of a Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), created under the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill in 1972. However, this was not an ‘independent authority’ but functioned instead as a delegated entity under the Attorney General.186 The DPP was accountable to both the Attorney General and Ministry of Justice. The Supreme Court was also empowered by writ to direct the Director of Public Prosecutions to act. However, this office was abolished in 1978 after it came under direct political pressure.187 The wide prosecutorial discretion vested with the Attorney General’s Department can easily become subject to political interference, due to the nature of its close political association. It is in this light, that – even if a national prosecution service was not created – the AG’s discretion must be structured and exercised subject to pre-determined and established criteria. The structuring of the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General through clearly established guidelines regarding the institution, maintaining and withdrawing of cases could resolve many of the issues highlighted in this Annex, mainly political interference and issues pertaining to the administration of justice. This would be in keeping with the spirit of the IAP guidelines mentioned at the beginning of this Annex. As mentioned previously, the Crown Prosecution Service of England & Wales, while looking into cases that have been investigated by the police and other investigative mechanisms, remains independent of the police and government. It functions through the establishment of detailed guidelines on a wide variety of aspects related to prosecution, primarily captured in the “Code for Crown Prosecutors”188 – a document mentioned earlier in this report. The guidelines attempt to provide objective criteria, focusing on independence and fairness. For example, the Code prescribes the “Full Code Test” or in the alternative the “Threshold Test” for the prosecution of crimes by the Crown. The manner and criteria for the disposals of cases are also clearly identified and defined, ensuring the independence and impartiality of the Service. In summary, the current situation in Sri Lanka is highly problematic, given the lack of clarity concerning essential investigative and prosecutorial processes, in particular the opacity of the relationship between CIABOC and the Attorney General’s Department. CIABOC is the centrepiece of the new Anti- Corruption Act of 2023 and will be central to the effort to disrupt corrupt practices in Sri Lanka. But that will only succeed if there is meaningful clarity of its functional relationships with other government bodies, in particular the Attorney General’s Department. We have seen that a lack of transparency leads to sub-optimal results and a significant lack of public trust. That trust must now be rebuilt if Sri Lanka is to effectively free itself of the significant burden of the past and move forward meaningfully with its new agenda of transparency and effectiveness. 186 International Committee of Jurists (2012) ‘Authority without Accountability: The crisis of impunity in Sri Lanka’ http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/50ae365b2.pdf - accessed 07/20/2023. 187 Pinto- Jayawardena, K.

    "text": "One possible means of tackling this - and as a minimum recommendation - is the introduction of a comprehensive series of guidelines which might help to address the ongoing public perception of opacity and political influence in the prosecutorial function of the AG’s Department in Sri Lanka. These steps to improve the transparency of existing arrangements should be taken immediately, as they respond to a pressing need not only to rebuild public trust but to attempt to improve the effectiveness of the AG’s Department. A second, and preferable, means of addressing the problem in the Sri Lankan context would be to create an independent prosecution service such as those adopted in the vast majority of common law jurisdictions and as outlined above. Sri Lanka really is a significant outlier when compared with its common law cousins, who have all recognised the need to address independence but also crucial public perception through removing the prosecution function from the Attorney General. Provided it is Sri Lanka-specific and tailored effectively to the country context, such a move would improve not only the functionality of the relationship between CIABOC and the prosecution agency but would also go some considerable way to ease public concerns that the ‘new CIABOC’ - regardless of its new remit and powers - will remain shackled to the past and unable to reach its potential because it remains subject to the political influence of the Attorney Generals’ Department. ----------------------------------------------------------- IMF | Technical Report – Sri Lanka Governance Diagnostic Assessment | 138",
