In response to requests by country authorities, teams consisting of staff from relevant\nfunctional departments2 have completed 15 diagnostic assessments, for the most part in a\nFund-supported program context. In close collaboration with government counterparts, these\ndiagnostics are designed to assess the severity of corruption and identify the governance\nweaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities across six core state functions provided by the 2018\nFramework. As a forward-looking exercise, they recommend concrete structural reform measures\nto advance governance, integrity, and the rule of law, and produce a public report. Depending on\nthe circumstances, each diagnostic takes up to twelve months. As an evolving tool, assessments\nhave reflected strong commonality in coverage, as well as substantial variation in structure, size,\nnumber of recommendations, and follow-up. Findings of the diagnostics have regularly informed\nFund-supported programs, including through conditionality, surveillance in the context of Article\nIV missions, capacity development work, and authorities’ reforms efforts.\nA. Overview of Governance Diagnostic Assessments\n1. Since the adoption of the Framework for Enhanced Fund Engagement on Governance\nin 2018, 15 governance diagnostics have been completed, with six more assessments\nunderway.3 The diagnostics are undertaken in response to requests from the authorities. While the\nnumber of requests decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, some diagnostics have been\nconducted during the COVID-19 travel ban. The Sudan and Mali diagnostics were undertaken in a\nfull remote mode, while the exercises in Zambia and Mauritania were hybrid. Governance\ndiagnostics are designed to provide a holistic analysis and strategic recommendations for improving\nintegrity and governance in a member country. The assessments examine the severity of corruption\nin a country, which informs the identification and analysis of governance weaknesses associated with\ncorruption vulnerabilities across the six core state functions covered by the 2018 Framework: (i) fiscal\ngovernance; (ii) rule of law (contract enforcement and protection of property rights); (iii) market\nregulation; (iv) central bank governance and operation; (v) financial sector oversight; and (vi)\nAML/CFT. They also assess the effectiveness of anti-corruption legal and institutional frameworks.\nThe governance diagnostic report that is produced is part of a longer process of engagement on\n1 Prepared by Tina Burjaliani, Ron Snipeliski and Joel Turkewitz (all LEG), Veronique Salins and Olivier Basdevant (both\nFAD).\n2 Governance diagnostic missions are a cross-department exercise (co-led by LEG and FAD), with participation of\nMCM and FIN in most missions. Other international institutions have also participated in some missions.\n3 The first comprehensive diagnostic assessment of governance and corruption took place in 2014 for Ukraine, prior\nto the adoption of 2018 Framework. See “Government of Ukraine Report on Diagnostic Study of Governance Issues\nPertaining to Corruption, the Business Climate and the Effectiveness of the Judiciary”, July 11, 2014.\n6 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\n©International Monetary Fund.

      "ASSESSMENTS\nThis background paper takes stock of the experiences with governance diagnostic assessments\nsince 2018. In response to requests by country authorities, teams consisting of staff from relevant\nfunctional departments2 have completed 15 diagnostic assessments, for the most part in a\nFund-supported program context. In close collaboration with government counterparts, these\ndiagnostics are designed to assess the severity of corruption and identify the governance\nweaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities across six core state functions provided by the 2018\nFramework. As a forward-looking exercise, they recommend concrete structural reform measures\nto advance governance, integrity, and the rule of law, and produce a public report. Depending on\nthe circumstances, each diagnostic takes up to twelve months. As an evolving tool, assessments\nhave reflected strong commonality in coverage, as well as substantial variation in structure, size,\nnumber of recommendations, and follow-up. Findings of the diagnostics have regularly informed\nFund-supported programs, including through conditionality, surveillance in the context of Article\nIV missions, capacity development work, and authorities’ reforms efforts.\nA. Overview of Governance Diagnostic Assessments\n1. Since the adoption of the Framework for Enhanced Fund Engagement on Governance\nin 2018, 15 governance diagnostics have been completed, with six more assessments\nunderway.3 The diagnostics are undertaken in response to requests from the authorities. While the\nnumber of requests decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, some diagnostics have been\nconducted during the COVID-19 travel ban. The Sudan and Mali diagnostics were undertaken in a\nfull remote mode, while the exercises in Zambia and Mauritania were hybrid. Governance\ndiagnostics are designed to provide a holistic analysis and strategic recommendations for improving\nintegrity and governance in a member country. The assessments examine the severity of corruption\nin a country, which informs the identification and analysis of governance weaknesses associated with\ncorruption vulnerabilities across the six core state functions covered by the 2018 Framework: (i) fiscal\ngovernance; (ii) rule of law (contract enforcement and protection of property rights); (iii) market\nregulation; (iv) central bank governance and operation; (v) financial sector oversight; and (vi)\nAML/CFT. They also assess the effectiveness of anti-corruption legal and institutional frameworks.\nThe governance diagnostic report that is produced is part of a longer process of engagement on\n1 Prepared by Tina Burjaliani, Ron Snipeliski and Joel Turkewitz (all LEG), Veronique Salins and Olivier Basdevant (both\nFAD).\n2 Governance diagnostic missions are a cross-department exercise (co-led by LEG and FAD), with participation of\nMCM and FIN in most missions. Other international institutions have also participated in some missions.\n3 The first comprehensive diagnostic assessment of governance and corruption took place in 2014 for Ukraine, prior\nto the adoption of 2018 Framework.

Outcomes of Ukraine’s 2014 Governance and Corruption Diagnostic\nIn 2014, with staff support, Ukraine’s authorities published a diagnostic report analyzing key\ncorruption vulnerabilities and outlining a roadmap for anti-corruption reforms. Following the\n“Maidan” Revolution, the new government had identified governance and anti-corruption as a top priority.\nThe report, published as a policy commitment under the IMF-supported program, highlighted the\npervasiveness and oppressive nature of corruption in the country. Powerful blocks of political and economic\nelites were seen as entrenched throughout public institutions and the economy (i.e., state capture). The state\nagencies responsible for enforcing anti-corruption frameworks (e.g., police, prosecutor general’s office, and\njudiciary) were viewed as the most corrupt public institutions, which had abused their powers to benefit the\nelites. The report notably concluded that, while formal frameworks were overall aligned with international\nstandards, their implementation to high-level corrupt officials was lacking. A credible threat of\nconsequences for corrupt acts had to be enforced, particularly by establishing independent enforcement\nagencies to hold public officials accountable and prevent them to benefit from the proceeds of corruption.\nInformed by the diagnostic report, Ukraine has achieved significant progress in operationalizing a\nrobust anti-corruption infrastructure. Under the IMF-supported programs and with support from capacity\ndevelopment providers, the pillars of the new anti-corruption infrastructure were established in succession:\ninvestigation (the National Anti-Corruption Bureau in 2015); prosecution (the Specialized Anti-Corruption\nProsecutor’s Office in 2017), and adjudication (the High Anti-Corruption Court in 2019). Members of\nparliament, ministers and judges have since been subject to corruption investigations, prosecutions, and\nconvictions, including by relying on the implementation of other reforms contemplated in the diagnostic\nreport such as asset declarations, the criminalization of illicit enrichment, and AML tools. These agencies\nhave continued to operate despite the war demonstrating sustainability of the reform efforts. With time,\njudicial corruption became a critical issue, as vested interests were seen as misusing the judicial system to\nreverse reforms.
