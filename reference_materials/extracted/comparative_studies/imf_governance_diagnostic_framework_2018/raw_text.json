It presents additional analysis on the following topics: • Section I: Experiences with Governance Diagnostic Assessments. Takes stock of the experiences with governance diagnostic assessments since 2018 highlighting their scope, functions, and engagement with the authorities and other stakeholders. • Section II: Mitigating Corruption Risks in Emergency Spending: Lessons Learned from the IMF’s Experience During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Reflects on the IMF approach to governance safeguards in emergency financing during the COVID-19 pandemic and identifies preliminary lessons learnt, including to inform future emergency financing response. • Section III: Role of Supreme Audit Institutions to Address Corruption Risk. Reviews Supreme Audit Institutions’ increased focus on issues relating to corruption, before providing an overview of experience in the Fund’s engagement with SAIs, and elaborating three core principles to inform IMF staff work going forward. • Section IV: Transnational Aspects of Corruption. Briefs about the existing framework for combating the transnational aspects of corruption, takes stock of the coverage in IMF Article IV Staff Reports since April 2018 and discusses lessons learnt, and proposes sustaining and deepening the coverage in Staff Reports going forward. ©International Monetary Fund.

In response to requests by country authorities, teams consisting of staff from relevant functional departments2 have completed 15 diagnostic assessments, for the most part in a Fund-supported program context. In close collaboration with government counterparts, these diagnostics are designed to assess the severity of corruption and identify the governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities across six core state functions provided by the 2018 Framework. As a forward-looking exercise, they recommend concrete structural reform measures to advance governance, integrity, and the rule of law, and produce a public report. Depending on the circumstances, each diagnostic takes up to twelve months. As an evolving tool, assessments have reflected strong commonality in coverage, as well as substantial variation in structure, size, number of recommendations, and follow-up. Findings of the diagnostics have regularly informed Fund-supported programs, including through conditionality, surveillance in the context of Article IV missions, capacity development work, and authorities’ reforms efforts. A. Overview of Governance Diagnostic Assessments 1. Since the adoption of the Framework for Enhanced Fund Engagement on Governance in 2018, 15 governance diagnostics have been completed, with six more assessments underway.3 The diagnostics are undertaken in response to requests from the authorities. While the number of requests decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, some diagnostics have been conducted during the COVID-19 travel ban. The Sudan and Mali diagnostics were undertaken in a full remote mode, while the exercises in Zambia and Mauritania were hybrid. Governance diagnostics are designed to provide a holistic analysis and strategic recommendations for improving integrity and governance in a member country. The assessments examine the severity of corruption in a country, which informs the identification and analysis of governance weaknesses associated with corruption vulnerabilities across the six core state functions covered by the 2018 Framework: (i) fiscal governance; (ii) rule of law (contract enforcement and protection of property rights); (iii) market regulation; (iv) central bank governance and operation; (v) financial sector oversight; and (vi) AML/CFT. They also assess the effectiveness of anti-corruption legal and institutional frameworks. The governance diagnostic report that is produced is part of a longer process of engagement on 1 Prepared by Tina Burjaliani, Ron Snipeliski and Joel Turkewitz (all LEG), Veronique Salins and Olivier Basdevant (both FAD). 2 Governance diagnostic missions are a cross-department exercise (co-led by LEG and FAD), with participation of MCM and FIN in most missions. Other international institutions have also participated in some missions. 3 The first comprehensive diagnostic assessment of governance and corruption took place in 2014 for Ukraine, prior to the adoption of 2018 Framework.

The majority of countries which requested a governance diagnostic were LIC and FCS (Table 1). Out of the 21 countries for which diagnostics have been or are being delivered, 10 are FCS. As mentioned in the IMF Strategy for FCS (adopted in March 2022), these diagnostics will inform more in-depth analysis on corruption and governance issues in surveillance, where needed. Governance diagnostics have been concentrated in countries with severe and systematic corruption issues. The participating countries are spread across different income levels (covering both low-income and middle-income countries) and generally perform poorly on control of corruption indicators. 3. Ten out of the 15 completed reports have been published, with the approval of participating authorities (Table 1). Publication of the report is encouraged, as transparency on the findings and recommendations is an important contribution to good governance. Authorities have published the report on their own web sites in number of cases, demonstrating strong ownership of the report and their active engagement defining future actions.

Overall, governance diagnostics inform longer term engagement on governance and corruption with country authorities. To illustrate this long term impact of diagnostic reports, it is useful to refer to the first governance diagnostic supported by IMF staff and published by Ukraine’s authorities in 2014, which has been a precursor for the diagnostic reports discussed in this paper. Box 1 below summarizes the experience with the implementation of anti-corruption recommendations over many years after the publication of the report. Box 1. Outcomes of Ukraine’s 2014 Governance and Corruption Diagnostic In 2014, with staff support, Ukraine’s authorities published a diagnostic report analyzing key corruption vulnerabilities and outlining a roadmap for anti-corruption reforms. Following the “Maidan” Revolution, the new government had identified governance and anti-corruption as a top priority. The report, published as a policy commitment under the IMF-supported program, highlighted the pervasiveness and oppressive nature of corruption in the country. Powerful blocks of political and economic elites were seen as entrenched throughout public institutions and the economy (i.e., state capture). The state agencies responsible for enforcing anti-corruption frameworks (e.g., police, prosecutor general’s office, and judiciary) were viewed as the most corrupt public institutions, which had abused their powers to benefit the elites. The report notably concluded that, while formal frameworks were overall aligned with international standards, their implementation to high-level corrupt officials was lacking. A credible threat of consequences for corrupt acts had to be enforced, particularly by establishing independent enforcement agencies to hold public officials accountable and prevent them to benefit from the proceeds of corruption. Informed by the diagnostic report, Ukraine has achieved significant progress in operationalizing a robust anti-corruption infrastructure. Under the IMF-supported programs and with support from capacity development providers, the pillars of the new anti-corruption infrastructure were established in succession: investigation (the National Anti-Corruption Bureau in 2015); prosecution (the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office in 2017), and adjudication (the High Anti-Corruption Court in 2019). Members of parliament, ministers and judges have since been subject to corruption investigations, prosecutions, and convictions, including by relying on the implementation of other reforms contemplated in the diagnostic report such as asset declarations, the criminalization of illicit enrichment, and AML tools. These agencies have continued to operate despite the war demonstrating sustainability of the reform efforts. With time, judicial corruption became a critical issue, as vested interests were seen as misusing the judicial system to reverse reforms. The authorities subsequently engaged, in the context of the Fund-supported program, in targeted reforms to strengthen the rule of law and enhance the independence, integrity and accountability of judges, specifically by improving procedures for competitive selection for the members of the judicial self-governance body. 10 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND ©International Monetary Fund.

In line with the 2022 Fund policy on engagement with Fragile and Conflict-Affected States, a careful balance needs to be sought between fragility/political economy constraints and the need for tackling governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities. Fragile states are often associated with systemic corruption, which creates and exacerbates governance weaknesses. Governance diagnostics in such jurisdictions require careful consideration of the stability of the local environment, adjusting reform timelines in line with operative conditions, while ensuring adequate leverage from development partners to amplify the impact. At the same time, governance diagnostics can prove to be particularly useful in informing the Fund’s engagement in FCS context. 15. Analysis of the severity of corruption, and corruption risks in the six state functions should more closely guide the formulation of recommendations, to effectively inform subsequent work by Area departments. Where corruption risks are deemed high and widespread, a deeper understanding of the nature and severity of corruption and identifying the most macro- critically relevant corruption vulnerabilities should facilitate the selection of issues to be addressed and the adoption of a holistic and integrated approach to the analysis. In this regard, having an in- depth discussion of corruption networks and the political economy helps set the stage of the analysis and recommendations for each state function. 16.
