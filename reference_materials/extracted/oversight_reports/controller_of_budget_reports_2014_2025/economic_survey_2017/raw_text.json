Below are a few quality observations to be taken into account when using the statistics in Economic Survey 2017. Data sources The statistics presented in Economic Survey 2017 are based on a wide variety of sources. In order to provide the most comprehensive picture of the economy and social situation in Kenya during 2016, KNBS has gathered data from its own surveys, surveys carried out by other institutions and administrative data collected by Ministries, Government Departments and Agencies. The source of the data is always noted directly alongside the table or in the explanatory text. More details about the data may be obtained from the responsible primary data source agency. Accuracy and reliability The surveys carried out by KNBS are primarily based on samples of the population. Although the sample surveys are representative of the total units, in some instances, sampling errors may occur, such as bias. Other non-sampling errors may also exist, such as due to respondent fatigue (when respondents do not answer a questionnaire, either fully or partially). However, the Surveys conducted by KNBS are always based on international standards and methods, and mitigation measures are always taken in order to minimize these errors. Whenever such errors occur, they are documented fully. Data from administrative sources may also be subject to certain errors, such as undercoverage in the source (where it has not been possible to collect data) and differences in definitions and categorization. Periodicity Some of the data presented cover the calendar year (e.g. 2016) and some cover financial years, (e.g. from July 2015 to June 2016, presented as 2015/16). Where necessary, the period covered by the data is specified in the table and/or the explanatory text. Consistency Where data is available, KNBS has endeavoured to provide the same statistical tables as in previous years to enable consistency and trend comparison over time. In terms of consistency between data, some definitions and categories, such as age groups, may differ between datasets due to the varying data sources. Accessibility Economic Survey reports, including this edition, are uploaded on KNBS´website for download free-of-charge in pdf format. The publication is also available in hard copy from KNBS at a small fee. Further details on the data are available from respective Directorates in KNBS. iv",

    "text": "Summary and Outlook Summary and Outlook International Scene The global economy is estimated to have expanded by 2.9 per cent in 2016 compared to a revised growth of 3.1 per cent in 2015. Growth in advanced economies expanded by 2.1 per cent in 2016 compared to 1.9 per cent in 2015. The United States of America recorded a growth of 1.5 per cent in 2016 compared to 2.6 per cent in 2015, mainly due to weak exports, subdued investments and uncertainty surrounding the 2016 elections. Growth in China decelerated on account of slowed investment as the economy rebalanced towards services and consumption. In Japan, growth was boosted by private consumer spending, signaling improved consumer purchasing power after two years of contraction. The Sub-Saharan Africa’s real gross domestic product is estimated to have grown by 1.5 per cent in 2016 compared to 3.8 per cent growth registered in 2015. Global inflation was estimated at 2.9 per cent compared to 2.8 per cent recorded in 2015. In emerging markets and developing economies, headline inflation remained steady as currencies remained broadly stable, or appreciated in some cases. Growth of the global trade slowed in 2016 to 1.9 percent from 2.6 per cent growth in 2015. Global unemployment rate was estimated at 5.7 per cent in 2016 compared to 5.8 per cent in 2015. Domestic Economy Kenya’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to have expanded by 5.8 per cent in 2016 compared to a revised growth of 5.7 per cent in 2015. Accommodation and food services recorded improved growth of 13.3 per cent in the year under review compared to a contraction of 1.3 per cent in 2015. The other sectors that registered significant improved performance in economic activities were in the information and communication; real estate; and transport and storage. Persistent drought hampered growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 impacting negatively on agriculture and electricity supply. On the other hand, growth in construction; mining and quarrying; and financial and insurance activities decelerated in 2016. From the demand side, growth was buoyed by consumption in both the public and private sector. Annual average inflation eased to 6.3 per cent in 2016 compared to an average of 6.6 per cent in 2015. This was mainly due to decline in prices of transportation; housing and utilities; and communication. The Shilling strengthened against the Pound Sterling, South African Rand, Ugandan Shilling, Tanzanian Shilling and the Rwandan Franc but weakened against the US Dollar, Euro, and the Yen in 2016. The capping of interest rates to a maximum of 4.0 per cent above the Central Bank Rate (CBR) resulted in a significant decline in interest rates during the month of September to 13.84 per cent compared to 16.75 in a similar month in 2015. Domestic credit slowed from a growth of 20.8 per cent in 2015 to 6.4 per cent in 2016 mainly on account of a decline in credit to the private sector. The current account deficit narrowed to KSh 370.8 billion in 2016 from a deficit of KSh 421.1 billion in 2015. The fiscal deficit in 2016/17 as a percentage of GDP is expected to rise to 9.9 per cent compared to 8.6 per cent in 2015/16.

      "Summary and Outlook Summary and Outlook International Scene The global economy is estimated to have expanded by 2.9 per cent in 2016 compared to a revised growth of 3.1 per cent in 2015. Growth in advanced economies expanded by 2.1 per cent in 2016 compared to 1.9 per cent in 2015. The United States of America recorded a growth of 1.5 per cent in 2016 compared to 2.6 per cent in 2015, mainly due to weak exports, subdued investments and uncertainty surrounding the 2016 elections. Growth in China decelerated on account of slowed investment as the economy rebalanced towards services and consumption. In Japan, growth was boosted by private consumer spending, signaling improved consumer purchasing power after two years of contraction. The Sub-Saharan Africa’s real gross domestic product is estimated to have grown by 1.5 per cent in 2016 compared to 3.8 per cent growth registered in 2015. Global inflation was estimated at 2.9 per cent compared to 2.8 per cent recorded in 2015. In emerging markets and developing economies, headline inflation remained steady as currencies remained broadly stable, or appreciated in some cases. Growth of the global trade slowed in 2016 to 1.9 percent from 2.6 per cent growth in 2015. Global unemployment rate was estimated at 5.7 per cent in 2016 compared to 5.8 per cent in 2015. Domestic Economy Kenya’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to have expanded by 5.8 per cent in 2016 compared to a revised growth of 5.7 per cent in 2015. Accommodation and food services recorded improved growth of 13.3 per cent in the year under review compared to a contraction of 1.3 per cent in 2015. The other sectors that registered significant improved performance in economic activities were in the information and communication; real estate; and transport and storage. Persistent drought hampered growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 impacting negatively on agriculture and electricity supply. On the other hand, growth in construction; mining and quarrying; and financial and insurance activities decelerated in 2016. From the demand side, growth was buoyed by consumption in both the public and private sector. Annual average inflation eased to 6.3 per cent in 2016 compared to an average of 6.6 per cent in 2015. This was mainly due to decline in prices of transportation; housing and utilities; and communication. The Shilling strengthened against the Pound Sterling, South African Rand, Ugandan Shilling, Tanzanian Shilling and the Rwandan Franc but weakened against the US Dollar, Euro, and the Yen in 2016. The capping of interest rates to a maximum of 4.0 per cent above the Central Bank Rate (CBR) resulted in a significant decline in interest rates during the month of September to 13.84 per cent compared to 16.75 in a similar month in 2015. Domestic credit slowed from a growth of 20.8 per cent in 2015 to 6.4 per cent in 2016 mainly on account of a decline in credit to the private sector. The current account deficit narrowed to KSh 370.8 billion in 2016 from a deficit of KSh 421.1 billion in 2015. The fiscal deficit in 2016/17 as a percentage of GDP is expected to rise to 9.9 per cent compared to 8.6 per cent in 2015/16. Social Scene National Government total expenditure on the social sector is expected to increase by 23.3 per cent to KSh 495.5 billion in 2016/17. Total recurrent expenditure is expected to grow by 17.5 per cent while total development expenditure is expected to substantially increase by 57.5 per cent.

Total import bill of petroleum products declined by 12.6 per cent to KSh 197.5 billion from KSh 226.1 in 2015. Total demand for petroleum products increased by 6.5 per cent to 5,046.9 thousand tonnes. Total installed electricity generating capacity declined to 2,325.7 Mega-Watt (MW) as at December 2016. Total electricity generation increased from 9,514.9 Giga-Watt hours (GWh) in 2015 to 10,057.7 GWh in 2016. Hydro power generation increased to 3,959.9 GWh in 2016. The number of connections under the Rural Electrification Programme (REP) rose by 38.2 per cent to stand at 972,018 customers as at the end of June 2016 from 703,190 customers in 2015. Manufacturing The manufacturing sector recorded a real growth of 3.5 per cent in 2016 compared to a revised growth of 3.6 per cent in 2015. The growth was as a result of reduced cost of production and increased volume output. Cement production increased by 5.6 per cent from 6,352.9 thousand tonnes in 2015 to 6,707.2 thousand tonnes in 2016. The Producer Price Index (PPI) increased marginally by 0.2 per cent in 2016. The increase was due to stability of prices of imported raw materials and reduced cost of electricity. Credit to manufacturing sector decreased by 4.6 per cent from KSh 290.9 billion in 2015 to KSh 277.4 billion in 2016. In the year under review, formal employment in the manufacturing sector went up marginally by 1.8 per cent to 300.8 thousand persons in 2016. The Export Processing Zones (EPZ) experienced growth in most of its performance indicators in 2016. Total capital investment of EPZ enterprises increased from KSh 48.1 billion in 2015 to KSh 51.2 billion in 2016. Building and Construction The construction industry grew by 9.2 per cent in 2016 from an expansion of 13.9 per cent registered in 2015. Increased activity in the construction of roads and development of housing also translated to an increase in employment in the sector from 148.6 thousand jobs in 2015 to 163.0 thousand jobs in 2016. Construction of Phase I of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) was at the final stages of completion as at the end of 2016. Overall expenditure on roads is expected to increase by 38.3 per cent from KSh 113.2 billion in 2015/16 to KSh 156.5 billion in 2016/17. Total development expenditure is also expected to grow by 31.7 per cent from KSh 87.8 billion in 2015/16 to KSh 115.6 billion in 2016/17.

Overall, gender disparity in the use of ICT remained low but tends to favour male users in 2016. Governance The Government continued to implement various institutional reforms to improve Governance in 2016. The reforms included; vetting of police officers, installation of a national secure communication network and surveillance system for the National Police Service (NPS) in Nairobi and Mombasa, and introduction of a ‘Roadmap Toolkit’ to guide training of police officers. During the same period, additional armored vehicles as well as transport trucks were procured to enhance capacity of the police to respond to emerging security threats. In the review period, the Judiciary operationalized the Employment and Labour Relations Court, formerly the Industrial Court, and the Environment and Land Court to High Court status. In 2016, the number of crimes reported to the police increased by 6.2 per cent to 76,986.

The impacts could further be experienced in sectors that have strong interlinkages with these industries. If the deceleration in growth of credit that started in 2016 continues, it is likely to constrain growth in 2017 especially in activities that are reliant on borrowing from commercial banks. Furthermore, sectors such as manufacturing are encountering more intensified competition in their traditional export markets which could delay the recovery in that sector.

If this occurs, growth in the road transport is likely to be suppressed due to rise in cost of intermediate inputs. The exchange rate is expected to remain stable due to significant level of reserves, the continued growth in emigrant remittances and sustainability of the current account deficit. On the demand side, growth is likely to be driven by both the public and private final consumption. Public final consumption is projected to expand as reflected in the 2017/18 national budget. Similarly, private consumption is likely to remain robust in 2017 and therefore boost economic growth. On the external front, world trade is projected to improve while the expansion of global economy is expected to be strong in 2017.

    "text": "Economic Survey 2017 01 International Scene Chapter Overview The global economy is estimated to have expanded by 2.9 per cent in 2016 compared to a revised growth of 3.1 per cent in 2015. The slowed growth was occasioned by constrained global trade, subdued investment and heightened policy uncertainty associated with the United Kingdom (UK) decision to leave the European Union (EU); and elections in the United States of America (USA). Growth in advanced economies expanded by 2.1 per cent in 2016 compared to 1.9 per cent in 2015. The United States of America recorded a growth of 1.5 per cent in 2016 compared to 2.6 per cent in 2015, mainly due to weak exports, subdued investments in the manufacturing sector and uncertainty surrounding the 2016 elections. Growth in China decelerated on account of slowed investment as the economy rebalanced towards services and consumption. In Japan, the level of economic activity was robust owing to fiscal support, lower oil prices and accommodative financial conditions. 1.2. In the Sub-Saharan Africa, lower commodity prices for metal exporting countries and domestic shocks from a generally less supportive global economic environment slowed the economic performance. The region’s real gross domestic product is estimated to have expanded by 1.5 per cent in 2016 compared to 3.8 per cent growth registered in 2015. The slowdown in growth was mainly on account of decelerated growth in South Africa and the oil exporting countries whose economic activities were strained by a considerable drop in international oil prices. However, growth remained solid in agricultural exporting countries as well as in the commodity importing economies. 1.3. During the period under review, global inflation was estimated at 2.9 per cent compared to 2.8 per cent recorded in 2015. In emerging markets and developing economies, headline inflation remained steady as currencies remained broadly stable, or appreciated in some cases. Rising input prices in many emerging economies particularly China, where producer price inflation became positive for the first time in four years also contributed to the rise in inflation. Core inflation remained comparatively stable at low levels, reflecting persistent economic slack and weak global price pressures, particularly in Japan where the effective exchange rate appreciated substantially over the past year. 1.4. Growth of the global trade slowed in 2016 to 1.9 per cent from 2.6 per cent growth in 2015. Imports from major economies such as China continued to depress trade flows. Similarly, the sharp drop in oil prices from mid-2014 to early 2016 resulted in income losses in oil exporting countries. The slowdown in global investment in 2015-16 also played an important role in slowing the pace of world trade as capital goods account for about one third of world goods trade. 1.5. The global unemployment rate was estimated at 5.7 per cent in 2016 compared to 5.8 per cent in 2015. This was occasioned by improvements in developed economies such as the United States of America and the European Union where unemployment levels fell by 1.4 million in 2016. Labour market conditions in emerging economies in Latin America and the Caribbean continued to deteriorate in 2016, resulting in a 6.7 per cent unemployment rate compared to a 6.5 per cent in 2015. 10",

The OECD real GDP growth slowed to 1.7 per cent in 2016 from a revised growth of 2.1 per cent in 2015. This was on account of shortfalls in both public and private investment, sluggish productivity growth, financial disruptions and heightened policy uncertainty notably in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. However, the Euro Area, Germany and Japan recorded modest growths during the review period. 1.7. The OECD inflation remained at 1.3 per cent as recorded in 2015, a reflection of relatively stable commodity prices’ regime in most economies even with the fall in energy prices that prevailed in the early part of 2016. The current account surplus as a percentage of GDP stood at 0.3 per cent in 2016 compared to 0.1 per cent in the previous year. Labour market in the OECD continued to perform well with the unemployment rate falling to 6.3 per cent in 2016 compared to 6.8 per cent in 2015. Euro Area 1.8. The Euro Area exhibited a slow recovery though economic performance differed across countries within the bloc. Real GDP in the bloc grew by 1.7 per cent, a 0.2 percentage point improvement from the growth in 2015. The marginal growth was realized against a backdrop of low demand as a result of depressed investment, banking sector fragilities and uncertainties regarding European integration. 1.9. Inflation eased to 1.0 per cent in 2016 compared to 1.1 per cent in 2015. Current account surplus improved to 4.1 per cent in the review period compared to 3.9 per cent in 2015, on account of reduced imports as domestic demand slowed in the Euro Area. In addition, subdued global trade and slower growth in the UK, following its decision to exit the European Union, weighed in on growth of exports in the Euro Area. Unemployment rate receded further to 10.0 per cent in 2016 from 10.9 per cent in 2015, albeit with wide variations across countries. United States of America 1.10. Economic performance in the United States of America decelerated to 1.5 per cent in 2016 compared to 2.6 per cent growth in 2015. The growth was curtailed by weak exports and subdued investments partly due to uncertainty surrounding the 2016 elections. Inflation remained low at 1.3 per cent in the review period. 1.11. Weak external demand and appreciation of the US dollar constrained growth of exports during the better part of 2016. In addition, the strong dollar held back activities in manufacturing sector while lower oil prices curtailed investment in mining and equipment weighing on imports. Against this backdrop, the current account deficit narrowed slightly to 2.5 per cent from 2.6 per cent of GDP in 2015. The labour market continued to perform well despite subdued productivity growth with unemployment rate falling to 4.9 per cent in 2016 compared to 5.3 per cent in 2015. United Kingdom 1.12. The United Kingdom’s real GDP growth decelerated to 2.0 per cent in 2016 compared to 2.2 per cent in 2015, an indication that the political and economic implications of referendum outcome somewhat led to weak business investment as major projects were deferred or cancelled.

    "text": "Economic Survey 2017 Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa (BRIICS) 1.15. Economic performance of the emerging economies of BRIICS registered an average real GDP growth of 4.6 per cent in 2016 compared to 5.2 per cent in 2015 as shown in Table 1.2. The growth was subdued in all the members in the bloc except Indonesia. 1.16. Brazil’s economy contracted by 3.5 per cent in 2016 compared to a contraction of 3.8 per cent in 2015. The slight improvement was attributed to diminishing political uncertainty, rising business and consumer confidence, and strengthening of investments. The weak Brazilian currency supported exports resulting in the improvement in current account deficit from 3.3 per cent in 2015 to 0.8 per cent in 2016. Inflationary pressures eased to 6.3 per cent in 2016 compared to 8.9 per cent in 2015. The Russian economy contracted by 0.6 per cent in 2016 compared to a contraction of 3.7 per cent in 2015. The slowed contraction was mainly due to accommodative fiscal policy and flexible exchange rate. Overall inflation eased to 7.2 per cent in the period under review compared to 15.5 per cent in 2015. 1.17. In China, real GDP expanded by 6.7 per cent in 2016 compared to a growth 6.9 per cent in 2015. This growth was mainly driven by a rebalancing of the economy towards services and consumption, fiscal and credit stimulus that focused on infrastructure investment, and household credit. The Indian economy recorded a decelerated real GDP growth of 6.6 per cent during the year under review compared to a growth of 7.6 per cent in 2015. Growth was supported by implementation of structural reforms, reduction in supply side constraints and favorable monsoon rainfall, which supported agriculture. In Indonesia, a favourable monetary policy supported domestic demand resulting to a real GDP growth of 4.9 per cent in 2016 compared to a growth of 4.8 per cent in 2015. Inflation slowed to 3.7 per cent in 2016 from 6.4 per cent in 2015. In South Africa, the economy expanded by 0.3 per cent in 2016 compared to a growth of 1.3 per cent in 2015. The growth was depressed by persistent drought, falling investment and political uncertainty during the period under review. High food prices led to a surge in the inflation from 4.6 per cent in 2015 to 6.4 per cent in 2016. Association of South Eastern Asia Nations (ASEAN-5) 1.18. The real GDP of the five members of the Association of South Eastern Asia Nations (ASEAN-5) remained at 4.8 per cent in 2016 due to weaker external demand experienced by both Vietnam and Malaysia. In Vietnam, severe drought and weak exports restrained growth resulting in real GDP expansion of 6.1 per cent in 2016 compared to 6.7 per cent in 2015. Growth in Malaysia was held back by lower revenue from energy exports, which narrowed the current account surplus. The economy recorded a decelerated growth of 4.3 per cent compared to a growth of 5.0 per cent in 2015. 1.19. In Thailand and Philippines, growth picked to 6.4 and 3.2 per cent in 2016 compared to 5.9 and 2.8 per cent in 2015, respectively. In Philippines, growth was boosted by accelerated implementation of public investment projects and continued strong growth of export in services. Thailand’s growth on the other hand was buoyed by improved confidence in the economy. Inflation for the region eased to 2.5 per cent in 2016 from 3.3 per cent in 2015. Sub-Saharan Africa 1.20. Real GDP growth in the Sub-Saharan Africa decelerated to 1.6 per cent in 2016 compared to 3.4 per cent growth in 2015. The slowdown was mainly attributed to low commodity prices, weak external demand, drought and insecurity. Currency depreciation coupled with rising food prices due to drought resulted in an increase in inflation from 7.0 per cent to 11.3 per cent in 2016. The current account deficit as a percentage of GDP narrowed to 4.5 per cent during the review period compared to 5.9 per cent in 2015. 14",

During the year under review, real GDP in the East Africa Community (EAC) is estimated to have grown by 6.1 per cent compared to 5.8 per cent growth in 2015. The growth was fueled by public infrastructure investment, buoyant private consumption and low oil prices. Tanzania recorded the highest real GDP growth in the region, expanding by 7.2 per cent in 2016 compared to a growth of 7.0 per cent in 2015. In Burundi, real GDP contracted by 0.5 per cent in 2016 compared to a contraction of 4.0 per cent in 2015. The bloc’s inflation eased to 5.6 per cent in 2016 from 5.8 per cent in 2015. Currency stability helped to keep inflation within the Central Bank target in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. The current account deficit as a percentage of GDP narrowed to 8.1 per cent in 2016. Southern African Development Community 1.22. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) recorded a slower growth of 1.6 per cent during the year under review compared to a growth of 2.7 per cent in 2015, mainly due to decelerating growth of South Africa’s economy. Growth was constrained by severe drought, which affected agricultural production in some member countries. In Zambia, drought significantly disrupted hydroelectric power generation. Inflation increased to 9.9 per cent in 2016 compared to 5.5 per cent in 2015, due to rising food prices. The region’s current account deficit narrowed to 5.0 per cent in 2016 from 6.1 per cent in 2015. Maghreb 1.23. The average real GDP of Maghreb countries grew by 1.4 per cent in 2016 compared to a growth of 0.8 per cent in 2015, supported by investment and public spending. Inflation rose to 5.3 per cent in 2016 from 5.2 per cent in 2015. Current account deficit as a percentage of GDP narrowed to 18.7 per cent in the year under review, an improvement from a deficit of 19.3 per cent in 2015. In oil importing countries, notably Morocco and Tunisia, falling oil prices helped to lower the current account deficit. Mashreq 1.24. The Mashreq region recorded a growth rate of 2.5 per cent in 2016 similar to that of 2015. The economy of Egypt grew by 3.8 per cent in 2016 compared to a growth of 4.2 per cent in 2015. The slowdown was mainly due to shortage of foreign currency that dampened manufacturing activities and the crash of a Russian plane in the Sinai Peninsula, which negatively impacted on tourism activities. The bloc’s current account deficit as percentage of GDP worsened to 11.7 per cent in 2016. In Egypt, a drop in remittances and official transfers coupled with weak tourism led to widening of the current account deficit to 5.8 per cent in 2016 from 3.7per cent in 2015. During the review period, Lebanon’s current account deficit as a percentage of GDP improved slightly to 20.4 per cent on account of falling oil prices. Outlook 1.25. The global real GDP is projected to grow by 3.3 per cent in 2017 based on the sustained growth in emerging and advanced economies. The real GDP in the advanced economies is projected to expand by 1.9 per cent in 2017 following strengthened recovery in the United States of America and fiscal stimulus in Japan. However, uncertainty associated with policies of the new administration in the United States of America and the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union are likely to influence growth of the advanced economies. 1.26. The OECD real GDP is projected to grow by 2.0 per cent in 2017. The increased policy uncertainty from UK decision to leave the EU and the banking sector concerns in the Euro Area are projected to slow down the economic growth of the bloc to 1.6 per cent in 2017.

The fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP is expected to rise to 9.9 per cent in 2016/17 compared to 8.6 per cent in 2015/16. Sectoral Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing Analysis 2.6. Activity in the Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing sector in 2016 were depressed compared to the performance recorded in 2015. The sector is estimated to have expanded by 4.0 per cent in 2016 down from a revised growth of 5.5 per cent in 2016. The decelerated performance was attributed to unfavourable weather conditions especially during the second part of the year when the country experienced a near failure of short rains. Though there were notable growths in production of coffee and tea, the sector’s growth was dampened by considerable declines in production of food crops. Production of tea and coffee increased by 18.5 and 10.8 per cent, in 2016, respectively. On the other hand, production of cereals and leguminous crops went down significantly in 2016. Specifically, production of maize declined from 42.5 million bags in 2015 to 37.1 million bags in 2016 while that of beans dropped from 8.5 million bags in 2015 to 8.1 million bags in 2016. Production of potatoes and drought resistant crops such as sorghum and millet recorded significant declines. 2.7. The volume of exports of cut flowers, fruits and vegetables rose by 8.9, 5.4 and 13.1 per cent, respectively, in 2016. This led to a 12.3 per cent growth in the value of fresh horticultural exports from KSh 90.4 billion in 2015 to KSh 101.5 billion in 2016. Performance of the sugarcane sub-sector was subdued by the dry weather conditions. As a result, the volume of cane deliveries declined from 7.2 million tonnes in 2015 to 7.1 million tonnes in 2016. 2.8. The livestock sub-sector showed mixed performance during the period under review. The volume of milk production increased from 615.9 in 2015 to 650.3 million litres in 2016. The number of animals slaughtered increased markedly in all categories of livestock. Manufacturing 2.9. The manufacturing sector recorded a decelerated growth of 3.5 per cent in 2016 from a revised growth of 3.6 per cent in 2015. The sector’s growth remained stifled in the period under review mainly attributable to underperformance of other sectors such as agriculture and electricity that provide inputs for manufacturing activities. The near stagnation in the growth of manufacturing was also manifest in the slow uptake of credit from KSh 290.1 billion in 2015 to KSh 276.7 billion in 2016. 2.10. The sector’s growth was mainly driven by processing of food products that recorded improved performance in 2016 though with evidently low magnitudes. The bulk of the growth was primarily accounted for by the value of output of processing and preservation of meat, and processing of dairy products in 2016. The expansion of the sub-sector was largely attributable to increased off take of livestock in 2016 occasioned by dry weather conditions. The growth was also supported by an increment of 45.4 per cent in the output of processed coffee in 2016. However, growth in the manufacture of food products was curtailed by poor performance in processing and preservation of fish as well as processing of fruits and vegetables that posted declines in the period under review. 2.12. Performance of the non-food sub-sector was varied in 2016. The sub-sector’s growth in output was mainly supported by manufacture of pharmaceutical products and preparations that rose by 25.7 per cent and manufacture of textiles and apparels that grew by 13.4 per cent in the period under review. Nevertheless, the growth was dampened by a significant drop in the output of manufacture of transport equipment at 27.4 per cent in 2016. 19",

Most sub-sectors in transport and storage posted notable growths except railways services that recorded a decelerated growth of 9.4 per cent in 2016 from a growth of 24.4 per cent in 2015. This was attributable to a 10.6 per cent drop in earnings from freight stream despite a marginal growth (2.0 per cent) in earnings from passenger traffic. Notably, air transport sub-sector rallied from a contraction of 0.7 per cent in 2015 to record a growth rate of 2.1 per cent in 2016. The sector was further supported by considerable growth in activity in transport through pipeline. Total pipeline throughput in thousand cubic metres increased from 5,712 in 2015 to 5,872.9 in 2016. 2.14 During the period under review, the sector benefited from a downturn in Murban ADNOC crude oil prices that dropped from USD 55.53 per barrel in 2015 to USD 44.18 per barrel in 2016. Consumption of all fuels used in transport namely; motor spirit, light diesel and jet fuel increased by 6.7, 12.0 and 5.0 per cent, respectively in 2016. In the domestic market, the average retail price of light diesel, which is a key input in the transport sector, dropped by 4.2 per cent in the year under review and therefore resulted in improved earnings from the sector. Information and Communication 2.15 Performance in the information and communication sector remained robust during the period under review mainly supported by the continued expansion of the scope of use of infor- mation and communication technologies coupled with greatly enhanced efficiency in connec- tivity. The sector recorded an accelerated growth of 9.7 per cent in 2016 after slowing down in 2015. This performance was significantly buoyed by improvement in the telecommunications sub-sector that grew by 11.2 per cent in 2016 compared to 8.6 per cent growth in 2015. In ad- dition, the growth was evidenced by a 7.7 per cent growth in the number of minutes of domes- tic calls made from 39.2 billion in 2015 to 42.2 billion minutes in 2016.The sector’s growth was further boosted by mobile money transfer and mobile commerce transactions that expanded to KSh 1.5 trillion and KSh 1.8 trillion, respectively. Financial Intermediation 2.16 The sector posted the slowest growth since 2012 to stand at 6.9 per cent in 2016 compared to 9.4 per cent in 2015. The relatively depressed performance was mainly as a result of a decelerated growth of 6.7 per cent in earnings from banking institutions partly due to uncertainty associated with the capping of interest rates that came into effect in September 2016. The sector’s performance was mirrored by the growth in broad money supply (M3) from 14.1 per cent in 2015 to 3.6 per cent in 2016. Similarly, expansion of domestic credit slowed notably from 20.8 per cent in 2015 to 6.4 per cent in 2016. Nonetheless, the sector’s growth was somewhat supported by the insurance sub-sector that posted a growth rate of 5.3 per cent in 2016 compared to 5.0 per cent in 2015.The underperformance in the financial sector was also manifest in the growth of credit to both the public sector and private enterprises. In 2016, growth of credit to the public sector plummeted from 24.5 per cent in 2015 to 9.1 per cent in 2016. Electricity Supply 2.17 The sector recorded a decelerated growth of 9.1 per cent in 2016 down from a revised growth rate of 11.5 per cent in 2015. The growth was supported by a significant increase in the total electricity generation increased from 9,514.9 GWh in 2015 to 10,057 GWh in 2016 on account of sufficient rains in the main catchment areas during the long rains season.

In 2016, growth of credit to the public sector plummeted from 24.5 per cent in 2015 to 9.1 per cent in 2016. Electricity Supply 2.17 The sector recorded a decelerated growth of 9.1 per cent in 2016 down from a revised growth rate of 11.5 per cent in 2015. The growth was supported by a significant increase in the total electricity generation increased from 9,514.9 GWh in 2015 to 10,057 GWh in 2016 on account of sufficient rains in the main catchment areas during the long rains season.

Consequently, generation from geothermal sources declined from 4,520.7 GWh in 2015 to 4,484.2 GWh in 2016 while that from thermal sources rose from 1,412.4 GWh in 2015 to 1,470.0 GWh, respectively in the review period. Generation of hydroelectric power was immensely constrained in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of failed short rains that characterized the quarter. Construction 2.18 The construction sector is estimated to have expanded by 9.2 per cent in 2016 compared to a relatively higher growth rate of 13.9 per cent recorded in 2015. The slower growth was principally due to a considerable reduction in the activity of the construction of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) as it neared completion. The significant reduction in the import of key construction materials such iron and steel (14.5 per cent) and non-ferrous metals (2.2 per cent) were also an indication of scaling down of construction activities related to the SGR. Further, the slowed growth was also evidenced by a slow uptake of loans in the building and construction sector from KSh 106.3 billion in 2015 to KSh 104.8 billion in 2016. The estimated value of building works completed in Nairobi City County rose from KSh 70.9 billion in 2015 to 76.2 billion in 2016. Similarly, the number of new private buildings in Nairobi City County grew from 9,054 in 2015 to 10,002 in 2016. The construction of new public residential buildings rose from 45 in 2015 to 1,062 in 2016. During the period under review, cement consumption increased by 10.4 per cent from 5.7 million tonnes in 2015 to 6.3 million tonnes in 2016, an indication of a robust growth despite the slowdown. Accommodation and Food Services (Hotel and restaurants) 2.19 The accommodation and food services sector recovered from a contraction of 1.3 per cent in 2015 to post a marked growth of 13.3 per cent in 2016. Earnings from tourism activities grew by 36.8 per cent from KSh 84.5 billion in 2015 to KSh 99.7 billion in 2016. The number of international visitor arrivals rose from 1,180.5 thousand in 2015 to 1,339.7 thousand in 2016. Consequently, hotel bed-nights occupancy rose by 9.7 per cent from 5,878.6 thousand in 2015 to 6,448.5 thousand in 2016. The satisfactory performance in this sector was supported by increased activity in conference tourism that comprised of visits by heads of states and high profile conferences coupled with concerted efforts to market Kenya as a preferred tourist destination. Further, the sector’s performance benefited from the reversal of travel advisories and other programmes such as charter incentive programmes and waiving of visa fees. 2.20 Tables 2.1 to Table 2.6 present details on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the period 2012-2016.

The GNI registered a nominal growth of 14.5 per cent to stand at KSh 7,089.3 billion in 2016. Similarly, the Gross National Disposable Income (GNDI) at current prices increased by 14.7 per cent from KSh 6,532.5 million in 2015 to KSh 7,417.1 million in 2016. Gross domestic product per capita rose from KSh 141,644 in 2015 to KSh 162,121 in 2016. Primary incomes receivable from the rest of the world decreased from KSh 48.3 billion in 2015 to KSh 44.0 billion in 2016. Despite a significant rise in diaspora remittances from KSh 154.1 billion in 2015 to KSh 177.1 billion in 2016, current transfers receivable from the rest of the world declined by 3.5 per cent to stand at KSh 333.0 billion in 2016.

The GNI registered a nominal growth of 14.5 per cent to stand at KSh 7,089.3 billion in 2016. Similarly, the Gross National Disposable Income (GNDI) at current prices increased by 14.7 per cent from KSh 6,532.5 million in 2015 to KSh 7,417.1 million in 2016. Gross domestic product per capita rose from KSh 141,644 in 2015 to KSh 162,121 in 2016. Primary incomes receivable from the rest of the world decreased from KSh 48.3 billion in 2015 to KSh 44.0 billion in 2016. Despite a significant rise in diaspora remittances from KSh 154.1 billion in 2015 to KSh 177.1 billion in 2016, current transfers receivable from the rest of the world declined by 3.5 per cent to stand at KSh 333.0 billion in 2016. This was largely on account of a decline in the current transfers receivable to general government. 32"

The gross Education total expenditure is expected to grow by 16.1 per cent from KSh 294.9 billion in 2015/16 to KSh 342.3 billion in 2016/17.

Total development expenditure is expected to grow substantially from KSh 14.6 billion in 2015/16 to KSh 24.2 billion in 2016/17. The increase is mainly attributable to a new policy put in place on financing of universities based on enrolment by course. This also covers the expansion of universities, financing of FPE and FDSE as well as the provision of loans and bursaries due to increased enrolment in university education, and vocational and technical training during the reference period.

Total development expenditure is expected to grow substantially from KSh 14.6 billion in 2015/16 to KSh 24.2 billion in 2016/17. The increase is mainly attributable to a new policy put in place on financing of universities based on enrolment by course. This also covers the expansion of universities, financing of FPE and FDSE as well as the provision of loans and bursaries due to increased enrolment in university education, and vocational and technical training during the reference period. Development expenditures for State Department of Basic Education and University Education are expected to account for 46.7 per cent and 38.6 per cent of the total development expenditure of the ministry, respectively, in 2016/17. 42"

Women in Decision Making: Improvement of the status of gender equality and empowerment of women is one of the Government’s primary goals. Table 3.30 presents the participation of women in key decision-making positions from 2015 to 2016. The representation of women in the National Assembly and Senate remained at 19.8 and 26.9 per cent of total Members of Parliament and Senators in 2016, respectively. The proportion of women cabinet secretaries and principal secretaries remained at 25.5 per cent and 36.6 per cent in 2016, respectively. The number of Magistrates, Practicing Lawyer, High Court Judges, County Commissioners, and Members of County Assembly met the constitutional threshold of one-third gender rule. 72"

Social Protection Fund: The Social Protection Fund (SPF) was established to minimize vulnerability across gender lines, reduce excessive inequality and disparities between social strata and to mitigate any distinction and exclusion. The funds allocated towards older persons are anticipated to decrease by 8.8 per cent from KSh 8.0 billion in 2015/6 to KSh 7.3 billion in 2016/17. In line with this, direct cash disbursements are also expected to decrease by 10.0 per cent to KSh 6.7 billion in 2016/17. This is mainly due to the decrease in the number of beneficiary households from 310,223 in 2015/16 to 279,150 in 2016/17. During the period under review, funds allocated for the Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) are expected to decrease by 18.6 per cent from KSh 9.7 billion in 2015/16 to KSh 7.9 billion in 2016/17. Consequently, direct cash disbursements are projected to decrease from KSh 8.439.6 million in 2015/16 to KSh 8,424.2 million in 2016/17. The number of beneficiary households decreased marginally from 351,650 in 2015/16 to 351,010 in 2016/17 as shown in Table 3.31.

The Act sets the maximum lending rate at no more than 4 per cent above the base rate set and published by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), and the minimum interest rate granted on a deposit held in interest earning account to at least 70 per cent of the Central Bank Rate (CBR). Consequently, following the implementation of the amended Act in mid-September 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) suspended the Kenya Bankers Reference Rate (KBRR), previously used as the base rate for pricing of loans by commercial banks. 5.2. In the review period, the CBR, was revised downwards twice, to 10.50 per cent in June and 10.00 per cent in December. During the first half of 2016, however, the base rate remained at 11.50 per cent. The monetary policy decisions were intended to support growth in the economy and to contain inflationary pressures amid fears of drought.

Similarly, overall domestic credit growth decelerated from 20.8 per cent in 2015 to 6.4 per cent in the same period, with credit to private sector expanding by 4.3 per cent in 2016 compared to 18.0 per cent in 2015.

Total domestic credit by the banking system grew by 6.4 per cent in December 2016 compared to a growth of 20.8 per cent in December 2015.

Credit to the National Government increased by 12.9 per cent from KSh 524.0 billion in 2015 to KSh 591.7 billion in 2016. Broad money supply (M3) grew by 3.6 per cent in 2016 to KSh 2,753.5 billion compared to an expansion of 14.1 per cent in December 2015.

Overall, to improve the effectiveness and efficacy of public spending, the fiscal framework designs the development budget based on individual projects; and institutes expenditure rationalisation on slow and delayed projects, and limits adoption of new projects to those critical in addressing emerging challenges of strategic importance. 6.2. Overall Fiscal Results: During the review period, the National Government budget is estimated at KSh 2,496.1 billion compared to KSh 2,047.4 billion spent in 2015/16. The recurrent expenditure is estimated at KSh 1,449.6 billion, while the development expenditure is estimated at KSh 1,046.5 billion. The budget on current transfers to county governments is estimated at KSh 284.8 billion while KSh 467.5 billion is budgeted for servicing of the public debt.

The development expenditure growth pattern is attributable to the continuing fiscal measures taken to reduce the growth of recurrent spending and give priority to the finalization of ongoing development projects. Expenditures on transport, fuel and energy, and public order and safety functions, are expected to account for 15.2, 3.8 and 5.9 per cent of the total outlays.

Similarly, the stock of internal debt rose by 19.4 per cent to KSh 1,407.1 billion during the same period. Growth in stock of bilateral debt in the review period was mainly driven by a rise in stock of debt from the People’s Republic of China, which rose by 24.2 per cent to KSh 313.1 billion, accounting for more than half of the total bilateral. Outstanding stock of debt from Japan and Germany also registered positive growths of 19.5 per cent and 37.1 per cent, respectively. These growths are mainly attributed to increased disbursements to finance infrastructure development. 6.16.

This led to narrowing of the trade deficit from KSh 996.5 billion in 2015 to KSh 853.7 billion, in 2016 and an improvement of export-import ratio from 36.8 per cent to 40.4 per cent over the same period.

Improved export unit prices of beverages and tobacco; animals and vegetable oils and fats; chemicals; and machinery and transport equipment, coupled with the declining import unit prices of mineral fuels, resulted in improvements in the terms of trade for all items by 2.8 percentage points to 78.8 per cent in 2016. The broad economic categories of food and beverages; consumer goods; and non-food industrial supplies contributed the highest proportion of total domestic exports at 45.2, 25.6 and 24.5 per cent, respectively, in 2016. Similarly, non-food industrial supplies; machinery and capital equipment; fuel and lubricants; and transport equipment contributed the highest share of the total import bill at 36.2, 21.8, 14.5 and 10.3 per cent, respectively, in 2016. Africa continued to be the leading destination of the country’s exports accounting for 40.6 per cent, with East African Community (EAC) accounting for 21.1 per cent of the total exports, in 2016. During the review period, Europe and Asia accounted for 24.5 and 24.3 per cent of the total exports, with European Union (EU) and the Far East accounting for 21.0 per cent and 15.6 per cent, respectively. The main source of imports was Asia accounting for 66.8 per cent with the Far East accounting for 53.2 per cent of the total imports during the review period. This is related to the ongoing construction of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR). Europe was the second largest source accounting for 18.5 per cent of the total imports with EU contributing 14.9 per cent in 2016. 7.3. The deficit in the current account narrowed by 11.9 per cent to KSh 370.8 billion in 2016 partly due to declines of 0.7 and 1.8 per cent in merchandise exports and imports on free on board basis, respectively. Net inflows of international trade in services increased by 32.7 per cent to a surplus of KSh 171.7 billion in 2016. The growth in earnings from services was mainly occasioned by increased foreign travel receipts boosted by conference tourism. The growth also supported the contraction in the current account deficit in the review period. Net financial inflows rose by 9.5 per cent to a surplus of KSh 420.0 billion in 2016 on account of short term capital flows.

Export and import unit price indices by commodity groups based on Standard changes International Trade Classification (SITC) for the period 2012 to 2016 are presented in Table 7.2(a). The unit price indices for all exports and non-oil exports declined by 4.7 per cent and 3.4 per cent, respectively, in 2016. This was mainly as a result of decreases in export unit prices of mineral fuels and inedible crude materials, which contracted by 40.1 per cent and 16.9 per cent, respectively, following the continued decline in oil prices. However, export price indices of beverages and tobacco; chemicals; and animal and vegetable oils and fats increased by 27.8, 19.4 and 14.7 per cent, respectively, in 2016. The unit price index for all imports went down by 7.7 per cent in the review period. This could be attributed to declines of 29.1 and 11.2 per cent, in import unit price indices of mineral fuels and miscellaneous manufactured articles, respectively, in 2016. There was a marginal decrease in unit price index for non-oil imports in 2016, following the declines in import unit price indices of miscellaneous manufactured articles (11.2 per cent), food and live animals (4.0 per cent) and manufactured goods (3.3 per cent). However, import price indices of beverages and tobacco; animals and vegetable oils and fats; and machinery and transport equipment rose by 12.8, 8.9 and 6.2 per cent, respectively, in 2016. 121",

      "Chapter 7: International Trade and Balance of Payment 2016. Imports remained subdued on account of lower global oil prices and reduced transport equipment acquisitions. 7.5. The decline in imports outweighed contraction in exports resulting in a 14.3 per cent improvement in the balance of trade deficit from KSh 996.5 billion in 2015 to KSh 853.7 billion in 2016. During the review period, the value of exports covered 40.4 per cent of the imports, an improvement from 36.8 per cent recorded in the previous year.

The share of non-food industrial supplies to the total expenditure on im- ports rose by 3.0 percentage points to 36.2 per cent to remain the leading category of imports in 2016. This was in spite of a marginal decline in the value of imports within this category from KSh 524.6 billion in 2015 to KSh 518.7 billion in 2016. Machinery and capital equip- ment was the second leading source of expenditure on imports in 2016 accounting for 21.8 per cent of the total import bill at KSh 312.1 billion. Fuel and lubricants accounted for 14.5 per cent of total expenditure on imports in 2016, down from 15.0 per cent in the previous year. This could be explained by a 12.3 per cent decline in the value of imports of fuel and lu- bricants from KSh 237.3 billion in 2015 to KSh 208.0 billion in 2016. There was a substantial decline in the value of imports of transport equipment from KSh 266.9 billion in 2015 to KSh 147.5 billion in 2016. This mainly resulted from a 69.1 per cent decline in the value of imports of industrial transport equipment from KSh 158.2 billion in 2015 to KSh 49.0 billion in 2016. Consequently, the share of imports of transport equipment to the total imports dropped to 10.3 per cent in 2016 from 16.9 per cent in 2015. 135",

Fuel and lubricants accounted for 14.5 per cent of total expenditure on imports in 2016, down from 15.0 per cent in the previous year. This could be explained by a 12.3 per cent decline in the value of imports of fuel and lu- bricants from KSh 237.3 billion in 2015 to KSh 208.0 billion in 2016. There was a substantial decline in the value of imports of transport equipment from KSh 266.9 billion in 2015 to KSh 147.5 billion in 2016. This mainly resulted from a 69.1 per cent decline in the value of imports of industrial transport equipment from KSh 158.2 billion in 2015 to KSh 49.0 billion in 2016. Consequently, the share of imports of transport equipment to the total imports dropped to 10.3 per cent in 2016 from 16.9 per cent in 2015. 135"

The value of total exports declined marginally from KSh 581.0 billion in 2015 to KSh of Trade 578.1 billion in 2016 as presented in Table 7.8. Africa remained the leading destination of Kenya’s exports; accounting for 40.6 per cent of total exports in 2016. This was despite a 3.1 per cent decline in the value of exports to the continent during the year to KSh 234.7 billion. Exports to the EAC accounted for slightly more than half of total exports to Africa. Europe was the second leading destination of exports accounting for 24.5 per cent of total exports in 2016. However, during the review period, exports to Europe registered a 3.0 per cent decline to KSh 141.5 billion. This followed a 3.7 per cent decline in exports to the European Union (EU) that accounted for 85.7 per cent of total exports to Europe. Total exports to the United Kingdom, traditionally one of the major destinations of Kenya’s exports within the EU, declined by 7.6 per cent to KSh 37.6 billion in 2016. Similarly, export earnings from Germany dropped by 4.8 per cent to KSh 11.9 billion in 2016. Exports to the Netherlands however, rose from KSh 42.0 billion in 2015 to KSh 43.5 billion in 2016, largely associated with expansion of horticulture exports. 7.19. Export earnings from Asia increased by 7.4 per cent to KSh 140.5 billion in 2016. Pakistan continued being a major destination of exports within Asia with export earnings rising from KSh 35.3 billion in 2015 to KSh 40.3 billion in 2016. The same trend was exhibited in export earnings from the United Arab Emirates which rose for the second consecutive year, to KSh 31.0 billion. Exports to China and India rose by 18.8 and 32.2 per cent to KSh 10.1 billion and KSh 11.9 billion, respectively, in 2016. Total export earnings from Afghanistan decreased by 26.2 per cent to KSh 10.7 billion. Revenue from total exports to America continued to grow for the fifth consecutive year, being KSh 52.9 billion in 2016. This was largely on account of increased exports to the United States of America (USA) which rose by an average of 6.4 per cent for the last two years to KSh 43.4 billion in 2016. Similarly, total exports to Canada have been on an upward trend for the third consecutive year. 7.20. Total export earnings from the EAC registered 4.0 per cent decline to KSh 121.7 billion, to account for 51.9 per cent of total exports to Africa, during the review period. The decline could partly be explained by contraction of exports to Uganda and Rwanda by 9.3 and 2.5 per cent, respectively. Some of the commodities that recorded declines in export earnings from Uganda included cement (34.7 per cent); petroleum oils (27.4 per cent); articles of plastics (29.0 per cent); soap, cleansing and polishing preparations (32.1 per cent); alcoholic beverages (28.2 per cent); and salt (12.0 per cent). Declines in the value of exports were recorded for the Democratic Republic of Congo (3.1 per cent), South Sudan (4.3 per cent), Sudan (10.2 per cent) and Zambia (12.5 per cent). Total exports to Tanzania grew from KSh 33.7 billion in 2015 to KSh 34.8 billion in 2016, mainly attributable to a 28.0 per cent growth in re-exports. Similarly, the value of exports to Egypt rose to KSh 20.6 billion on account of increase in tea exports, while those to Somalia grew to KSh 17.9 billion in 2016. Tea remained the leading export commodity to Egypt, constituting 88.7 per cent of total domestic export earnings in 2016. The robust growth in total exports to Somalia was a result of increase in earnings of vegetable materials and products which more than doubled in 2016. In addition, domestic exports of manufactured tobacco to Somalia rose, albeit marginally, during the year. 137",

    "text": "Chapter 7: International Trade and Balance of Payment 7.21. Expenditure on imports declined by 9.2 per cent to KSh 1,431.7 billion in 2016 as presented in Table 7.9. Asia accounted for 66.8 per cent of total value of imports in 2016 continuing its dominance as the leading source of Kenya’s imports. However, the value of imports from Asia reduced from KSh 981.7 billion in 2015 to KSh 956.7 billion in 2016. Imports from India declined by 18.6 per cent to KSh 205.5 billion during the same period. Similarly, the value of imports from Japan dropped by 6.6 per cent from KSh 88.2 billion in 2015 to KSh 82.4 billion in 2016. The value of imports from Israel nearly halved in 2016. Imports from China have continued to grow over the last five years making the country the leading source of Kenya’s imports in 2016. The value of imports from China rose from KSh 320.8 billion in 2015 to KSh 337.5 billion in 2016. The major commodities imported from China included; wind-powered generators, rails and signaling systems. The value of imports from the United Arab Emirates rose marginally from KSh 90.6 billion in 2015 to KSh 91.5 billion in 2016. Similarly, the value of imports from Saudi Arabia rose by 25.2 per cent over the same period. Petroleum products were the main items imported from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. 7.22. Europe accounted for 18.5 per cent of total expenditure on imports in 2016. Imports from Europe declined by 10.3 per cent to KSh 265.3 billion in 2016. This reduction was as a result of an 8.7 per cent drop in imports from the EU which constitute the largest share of imports from Europe. Imports from the United Kingdom declined for the third year in a row to stand at KSh 33.5 billion in 2016. Declines were also recorded in value of imports from Netherlands, Spain and Poland in 2016.

Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics are summarised in Table 7.11. The deficit in the current account narrowed by 11.9 per cent to KSh 370.8 billion in 2016 from 421.1 billion in 2015. This was partly due to a marginal decline of 0.7 per cent in merchandise exports and 1.8 per cent decrease in merchandise imports on free on board basis. Imports remained subdued on account of a depreciated Kenya Shilling and the reduction in transport equipment. The current account balance as a percentage of GDP was 5.2 per cent. 7.25. Net inflows in international trade in services increased by 32.7 per cent from a surplus of KSh 129.4 billion in 2015 to a surplus of KSh 171.7 billion in 2016. The growth in earnings from services was mainly occasioned by increased foreign travel receipts that rose by 17.6 per cent, boosted by conference tourism. Services payments decreased by 11.7 per cent to KSh 288.0 billion in 2016. The improvement in the services account mainly supported the narrowing in the current account deficit in the review period. 7.26. Net financial inflows went up by 9.5 per cent to a surplus KSh 420.0 billion in 2016. Other investment inflows increased by a surplus of 1.1 per cent to KSh 415.4 billion in 2016. However, foreign direct investment inflows declined by 34.4 per cent to a surplus of KSh 39.9",

Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics are summarised in Table 7.11. The deficit in the current account narrowed by 11.9 per cent to KSh 370.8 billion in 2016 from 421.1 billion in 2015. This was partly due to a marginal decline of 0.7 per cent in merchandise exports and 1.8 per cent decrease in merchandise imports on free on board basis. Imports remained subdued on account of a depreciated Kenya Shilling and the reduction in transport equipment. The current account balance as a percentage of GDP was 5.2 per cent. 7.25. Net inflows in international trade in services increased by 32.7 per cent from a surplus of KSh 129.4 billion in 2015 to a surplus of KSh 171.7 billion in 2016. The growth in earnings from services was mainly occasioned by increased foreign travel receipts that rose by 17.6 per cent, boosted by conference tourism. Services payments decreased by 11.7 per cent to KSh 288.0 billion in 2016. The improvement in the services account mainly supported the narrowing in the current account deficit in the review period. 7.26. Net financial inflows went up by 9.5 per cent to a surplus KSh 420.0 billion in 2016. Other investment inflows increased by a surplus of 1.1 per cent to KSh 415.4 billion in 2016. However, foreign direct investment inflows declined by 34.4 per cent to a surplus of KSh 39.9"

Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics are summarised in Table 7.11. The deficit in the current account narrowed by 11.9 per cent to KSh 370.8 billion in 2016 from 421.1 billion in 2015. This was partly due to a marginal decline of 0.7 per cent in merchandise exports and 1.8 per cent decrease in merchandise imports on free on board basis. Imports remained subdued on account of a depreciated Kenya Shilling and the reduction in transport equipment. The current account balance as a percentage of GDP was 5.2 per cent. 7.25. Net inflows in international trade in services increased by 32.7 per cent from a surplus of KSh 129.4 billion in 2015 to a surplus of KSh 171.7 billion in 2016. The growth in earnings from services was mainly occasioned by increased foreign travel receipts that rose by 17.6 per cent, boosted by conference tourism. Services payments decreased by 11.7 per cent to KSh 288.0 billion in 2016. The improvement in the services account mainly supported the narrowing in the current account deficit in the review period. 7.26. Net financial inflows went up by 9.5 per cent to a surplus KSh 420.0 billion in 2016. Other investment inflows increased by a surplus of 1.1 per cent to KSh 415.4 billion in 2016.

Coffee: Area, production and average yield of coffee by type of grower for the crop year s 2011/12 to 2015/16 is as shown in Table 8.13. Area under coffee production increased by 500 hectares to 114.0 thousand hectares in 2015/16. Coffee production increased by 9.8 per cent from 42.0 thousand tonnes in 2014/15 to 46.1 thousand tonnes in 2015/16. Production by co-operatives and estates increased by 13.2 per cent and 3.4 per cent to 30.8 thousand tonnes and 15.3 thousand tonnes, respectively. This increase in production may be as a result of the Government’s intervention of providing subsidized fertilizer and partly due to bi-annual cyclic production, where a good year of harvest is followed by reduced harvest in the following year. The average yield for co-operatives increased by 10.0 per cent while that of estates decreased by 0.7 per cent in the 2015/16 period. 152",

Food Balance Sheet (FBS) is a food security monitoring tool used to evaluate the overall food supply, utilization and calories available to the population. Food supply components include food production, imports, exports and changes in stocks. Utilization includes produced food used for human consumption, animal feed, seeds and industrial use. The food component is used to calculate the calories, proteins and fats available to the population in a given year. 8.30. A summary of the FBS indicators for the period 2012 to 2016 is shown in Table 8.23. Per Caput Daily Supply from calories decreased by 5.8 per cent from 2,288 thousand in 2015 to 2,156 thousand in 2016. Per Caput Daily Supply from proteins and fats decreased by 7.2 per cent and 6.4 per cent respectively, in 2016. The Self Sufficiency Ratio (SSR) for all food commodities and vegetable products increased marginally by 0.5 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively while the SSR for animal products decreased by 0.4 per cent in 2016. The overall Import Dependency Ratio (IDR) remained unchanged at 28.3 in 2016. During the review period, the IDR for vegetable products decreased by 0.6 per cent. The IDR for animal products increased from 0.8 in 2015 to 1.2 in 2016. The low IDR value is an indication of minimal reliance on imports of animal products during the review period. The Per Caput Daily Caloric Supply from vegetable decreased by 4.6 per cent from 1,975 thousand in 2015 to 1,885 thousand in 2016. The Per Caput Caloric Daily Supply from cereals decreased by 3.4 per cent from 920 thousand in 2015 to 890 thousand in 2016. Similarly, the Per Caput Daily Caloric Supply from animal products decreased by 13.1 per cent from 313 thousand in 2015 to 272 thousand in 2016.",

In 2016, the Government enacted Fisheries Management and Development Act 2016 and also continued to enforce controls for exploitation of fisheries resources. The Act provides for the conservation, management and development of fisheries and other aquatic resources and seeks to enhance the livelihood of communities that depend on fishing. The Act gives guidance on importation and exportation of fish and fish products, fish quality and safety. 9.11. The fisheries sub-sector registered a depressed performance for the second consecutive year, with total fish output dropping by 12.1 per cent from 146.3 thousand tonnes in the year 2015 to 128.6 thousand tonnes in 2016 as reflected in Table 9.4. This is reflected by the falling trend in fish production from all fresh water lakes and marine sources except for molluscs. 9.12. Freshwater fish production dropped by 12.3 per cent from 136.4 thousand tonnes in 2015 to 119.6 thousand tonnes in 2016. Lake Victoria continued to make a significant contribution accounting for 82.5 per cent of the total freshwater fish production. However, its output dropped by 10.2 per cent from 109.9 thousand tonnes in 2015 to 98.7 thousand tonnes in 2016. The decline is partly attributed to the presence of water hyacinth and destructive fishing methods. Similarly, the quantity of fish landed from Lake Turkana dropped by 24.5 per cent from 5.3 thousand tonnes in 2015 to 4.0 thousand tonnes in 2016. Fish production from the remaining lakes, Tana River dams and other areas also declined during the review period. The quantity of fish landed from fish farming dropped by 19.8 per cent from 18.7 thousand tonnes in 2015 to 15.0 thousand tonnes in 2016. 9.13. The marine fish landed declined by 10.6 per cent from 8.5 thousand tonnes in 2015 to 7.6 thousand tonnes in 2016. Crustaceans declined to 653 tonnes in 2016, while molluscs increased from 763 tonnes in 2015 to 824 tonnes in 2016. The decline is attributable to inadequate capacity to effectively utilize the Exclusively Economic Zone (EEZ). 9.14. The total value of fish landed declined by 11.5 per cent from KSh 20.9 billion in 2015 to KSh 18.5 billion in 2016. The value of fresh water fish dropped by 11.6 per cent from KSh 19.0 billion recorded in 2015 to KSh 16.8 billion in 2016. The value of marine fish and Crustaceans also decreased by 6.5 per cent and 32.7 per cent, to KSh 1,272 million and KSh 268 million, respectively, in 2016. However, the value of Molluscs increased from KSh 119 million in 2015 to KSh 141 million in 2016. 169",

Total sales of timber increased to 1,123.6 thousand true cubic metres in 2016 up from 633.5 thousand true cubic metres recorded in 2015. Sale of charcoal and fuel wood, increased to 113.7 thousand stacked cubic metres in 2016 from 43.7 thousand stacked cubic metres in 2015. This may be attributed to legalizing of sustainable charcoal production and trade under the Forest Act 2016. However, sale of power poles decreased significantly from 34.5 thousand in 2015 to 2.0 thousand in 2016. The drop may be attributed to a shift in sourcing of poles from outside the Government forests and use of concrete poles. 171",

Table 9.7 presents the recorded sale of Government forest products from 2012 to 2016. Total sales of timber increased to 1,123.6 thousand true cubic metres in 2016 up from 633.5 thousand true cubic metres recorded in 2015. Sale of charcoal and fuel wood, increased to 113.7 thousand stacked cubic metres in 2016 from 43.7 thousand stacked cubic metres in 2015. This may be attributed to legalizing of sustainable charcoal production and trade under the Forest Act 2016. However, sale of power poles decreased significantly from 34.5 thousand in 2015 to 2.0 thousand in 2016. The drop may be attributed to a shift in sourcing of poles from outside the Government forests and use of concrete poles. 171"

Supply continued to outstrip demand as a result of crude oil inventories, build up in the global market. The relatively high crude oil production and inventory levels led to reduction in international oil prices throughout the review period. Cooking gas average prices fell to an eight year low after the Government scrapped the applicable Value Added Tax (VAT) to boost uptake among poor households. 10.2. The volume of import of petroleum products increased from 4,431.7 thousand tonnes in 2015 to 4,852.4 thousand tonnes in 2016. Domestic exports of petroleum products declined from 30.4 thousand tonnes in 2015 to 26.9 thousand tonnes in 2016. During the same period, the total import bill of petroleum products decreased by 12.6 per cent to KSh 197.5 billion. Similarly, the total value of petroleum products exported declined by 28.4 per cent to KSh 42.8 billion. 10.3. Total installed electricity capacity declined marginally to 2,325.8 megawatts (MW) as at December 2016. The decline was mainly attributed to the drop in thermal capacity following the retirement of Aggreko plant in Muhoroni. Total effective capacity dropped by 8.0 per cent to 2,253.9 MW in 2016. 10.4. Domestic demand for electricity increased from 7,826.4 GWh in 2015 to 8,053.2 GWh in 2016. Total sales to large and medium commercial and industrial consumers; and domestic and small commercial increased from 7,272.7 GWh in 2015 to 7,462.0 GWh in 2016. The supply of electricity recorded a 5.7 per cent increase from 9,514.6 GWh to 10,057.7 GWh over the same period. The demand for rural electrification rose from 496.6 GWh in 2015 to 513.1 GWh in 2016. This resulted in an increase in the number of customers connected under the Rural Electrification Programme (REP) to 38.2 per cent from 703,190 in 2015 to 972,018 in 2016. Petroleum 10.5. Table 10.1 presents the quantity and value of imports and exports of petroleum products from 2012 to 2016. Total quantity of imports of petroleum products increased to 4,852.4 thousand tonnes in 2016. The volume of total exports of petroleum products rose by 9.3 per cent from 796.8 thousand tonnes in 2015 to 871.2 thousand tonnes in 2016. Total import bill of petroleum products declined from KSh 226.1 billion in 2015 to KSh 197.5 billion in 2016. This is mainly associated with reduced oil prices in the international market. The values of domestic exports and re-exports of petroleum products decreased by 29.7 per cent and 28.2 per cent to KSh 4.4 billion and KSh 38.5 billion, respectively, in 2016.

The volume of import of petroleum products increased from 4,431.7 thousand tonnes in 2015 to 4,852.4 thousand tonnes in 2016. Domestic exports of petroleum products declined from 30.4 thousand tonnes in 2015 to 26.9 thousand tonnes in 2016. During the same period, the total import bill of petroleum products decreased by 12.6 per cent to KSh 197.5 billion. Similarly, the total value of petroleum products exported declined by 28.4 per cent to KSh 42.8 billion. 10.3. Total installed electricity capacity declined marginally to 2,325.8 megawatts (MW) as at December 2016. The decline was mainly attributed to the drop in thermal capacity following the retirement of Aggreko plant in Muhoroni. Total effective capacity dropped by 8.0 per cent to 2,253.9 MW in 2016. 10.4. Domestic demand for electricity increased from 7,826.4 GWh in 2015 to 8,053.2 GWh in 2016. Total sales to large and medium commercial and industrial consumers; and domestic and small commercial increased from 7,272.7 GWh in 2015 to 7,462.0 GWh in 2016. The supply of electricity recorded a 5.7 per cent increase from 9,514.6 GWh to 10,057.7 GWh over the same period. The demand for rural electrification rose from 496.6 GWh in 2015 to 513.1 GWh in 2016. This resulted in an increase in the number of customers connected under the Rural Electrification Programme (REP) to 38.2 per cent from 703,190 in 2015 to 972,018 in 2016. Petroleum 10.5. Table 10.1 presents the quantity and value of imports and exports of petroleum products from 2012 to 2016. Total quantity of imports of petroleum products increased to 4,852.4 thousand tonnes in 2016. The volume of total exports of petroleum products rose by 9.3 per cent from 796.8 thousand tonnes in 2015 to 871.2 thousand tonnes in 2016. Total import bill of petroleum products declined from KSh 226.1 billion in 2015 to KSh 197.5 billion in 2016. This is mainly associated with reduced oil prices in the international market. The values of domestic exports and re-exports of petroleum products decreased by 29.7 per cent and 28.2 per cent to KSh 4.4 billion and KSh 38.5 billion, respectively, in 2016. The net balance declined by 7.0 per cent to KSh 154.7 billion in 2016 from KSh 166.3 billion in 2015. 178"

This increase is attributable to commissioning of geothermal projects namely Olkaria 11, Olkaria 12 Olkaria 13, Olkaria 14 and Olkaria 15, which contributed 25 MW. Thermal installed capacity declined from 833.8 MW recorded in 2015 to 803.5 MW in 2016. 10.13. Total effective capacity contracted marginally from 2,263.2 MW in 2015 to 2,253.9 MW in 2016. Geothermal effective capacity increased from 619.0 MW in 2015 to 644.0 MW in 2016. On the other hand, Thermal capacity declined from 797.1 MW recorded in 2015 to 764.9 MW in 2016, partly attributed to the retirement of Aggreko Muhoroni thermal plant (30MW) in June 2016.

Installed capacity refers to the maximum theoretical electric output a power station could produce when operating at 100 per cent Effective capacity is the capacity a power station is expected to achieve given current operating constraints. 10.14. Information on generation and imports of electricity from 2012 to 2016 is presented in Table 10.7b and Figure 10.3. Total electricity generation increased from 9,514.9 GWh in 2015 to 10,057.7 GWh in 2016. Hydro generation expanded from 3,463.3 GWh to 3,959.9 GWh in 2016. The increase is mainly attributed to increased hydrology at the end of 2015 and the long rains of 2016. Generation from geothermal plants dropped to 4,484.2 GWh in 2016 from 4,520.7 GWh in 2015. The reduced geothermal generation relative to the capacity installed is due to the scheduled maintenance of geothermal plants in the months of September to December 2016. Thermal generation rose from 1,412.1 GWh to 1,470.9 GWh during the same period. Overall, hydro and geothermal power accounted for the bulk of power with a total share of 84.0 per cent in 2016. 185",

Total installed capacity declined from 2,333.6 MW in 2015 to 2,325.8 MW in 2016. Geothermal installed capacity increased from 627.0 MW in 2015 to 652.0 MW in 2016. This increase is attributable to commissioning of geothermal projects namely Olkaria 11, Olkaria 12 Olkaria 13, Olkaria 14 and Olkaria 15, which contributed 25 MW. Thermal installed capacity declined from 833.8 MW recorded in 2015 to 803.5 MW in 2016. 10.13. Total effective capacity contracted marginally from 2,263.2 MW in 2015 to 2,253.9 MW in 2016. Geothermal effective capacity increased from 619.0 MW in 2015 to 644.0 MW in 2016. On the other hand, Thermal capacity declined from 797.1 MW recorded in 2015 to 764.9 MW in 2016, partly attributed to the retirement of Aggreko Muhoroni thermal plant (30MW) in June 2016. During the review period, Garissa and Lamu towns were connected to the national grid.

Installed capacity refers to the maximum theoretical electric output a power station could produce when operating at 100 per cent Effective capacity is the capacity a power station is expected to achieve given current operating constraints. 10.14. Information on generation and imports of electricity from 2012 to 2016 is presented in Table 10.7b and Figure 10.3. Total electricity generation increased from 9,514.9 GWh in 2015 to 10,057.7 GWh in 2016. Hydro generation expanded from 3,463.3 GWh to 3,959.9 GWh in 2016. The increase is mainly attributed to increased hydrology at the end of 2015 and the long rains of 2016. Generation from geothermal plants dropped to 4,484.2 GWh in 2016 from 4,520.7 GWh in 2015. The reduced geothermal generation relative to the capacity installed is due to the scheduled maintenance of geothermal plants in the months of September to December 2016. Thermal generation rose from 1,412.1 GWh to 1,470.9 GWh during the same period. Overall, hydro and geothermal power accounted for the bulk of power with a total share of 84.0 per cent in 2016. 185"

The beverages sub-sector grew by 5.6 per cent in 2016 mainly driven by production of beer and spirits, which went up by 11.8 per cent and 3.8 per cent, respectively. The growth in beer production was attributed to a 90 per cent remission of excise duty for beer made from domestically grown sorghum, millet or cassava. However, exports of beer in 2016 reduced by half from 65,073.3 thousand litres to 32,564.0 thousand litres, indicating that most of the beer produced was consumed locally. 11.13. Production of tobacco and cigarettes products dropped by 16.2 per cent and 16.4 per cent, respectively in 2016 while production of other manufactured tobacco products went down by 2.2 per cent. 11.14. Manufacture of textiles expanded marginally by 0.3 per cent in 2016. Production of twine, cordage and rope grew by 14.4 per cent while manufacture of blankets increased by 1.5 per cent in 2016. However, production of woven fabrics and knitting wool dropped by 7.4 per cent and 10.2 per cent, respectively. Manufacture of wearing apparel grew by 17.2 per cent in 2016 as a result of increased production of shirts and T-shirts by 17.4 and 20.9 per cent, respectively. 11.15. Leather and related products grew by 7.5 per cent in 2016. Finished leather recorded a 17.2 per cent growth in 2016 after registering a drop in 2015. Volume of exported leather dropped by 7.2 per cent in 2016, mainly attributed to the existing 80 per cent export tariff on raw hides and skin. Production of shoes with uppers of leather and shoes with uppers of plastic dropped by 21.6 and 3.5 per cent, respectively in 2016. This is partly attributed to competition from imports of low cost leather and non-leather footwear. 11.16. Manufacture of wood and products of wood, mainly consisting of plywood and block boards declined by 12.0 per cent in 2016. Manufacture of toilet paper and exercise books went up by 17.3 per cent and 6.6 per cent, respectively. Similarly, production of corrugated cartons registered a growth of 1.9 per cent.

Production of industrial gases declined by 12.2 per cent while that of industrial spirits increased by 6.1 per cent in 2016. Production of paints increased by 6.5 per cent while production of detergents and soaps went up by 2.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively. However, manufacture of shoe polish went down by 10.3 per cent. Overall, the chemical and chemical products sub-sector registered a marginal growth of 1.4 per cent in 2016. 11.18. Production of pharmaceutical products increased by 14.7 per cent in 2016 attributed to the increase in the production of capsules, tablets and syrups, which went up by 15.3, 14.9 and 11.8 per cent, respectively. Manufacture of rubber products, mainly the motor vehicle tyres, dropped by 24.4 per cent in 2016. On the other hand, manufacture of plastic products recorded a growth of 8.4 per cent driven by increased production of plastic tanks that recorded a significant growth of 17.0 per cent. The production of plastic pipes and plastic bags, recorded growths of 3.0 per cent and 0.7 per cent, respectively. 11.19. Basic metals sub-sector recorded a growth of 12.5 per cent in 2016. The quantity of iron sheets produced in 2016 went up marginally by 1.6 per cent, to 261.5 thousand metric tonnes, while its imports increased slightly by 0.7 per cent. This slow growth is an indication that the construction industry is adopting the use of alternative roofing materials to meet the increased demand in the construction sector.

    "text": "Chapter 12: Building and Construction 12 Building and Construction Chapter Overview The Government has continued in its efforts to develop efficient and effective infrastructure, which is a key enabler for other sectors as envisaged in Kenya Vision 2030. An improved road network enhances connectivity, mobility and promotes trade and investments by reducing cost of doing business. Significant progress has been made in the construction of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR). In addition, the construction of roads across major towns such as Nairobi and Kisumu gives impetus to the Government’s commitment to developing infrastructure to promote business. The construction industry grew by 9.2 per cent in 2016 from an expansion of 13.9 per cent registered in 2015. Increased activity in the construction of roads and development of housing also translated to an increase in employment in the sector from 148.6 thousand jobs in 2015 to 163.0 thousand jobs in 2016. 12.2. Overall expenditure on roads is expected to increase by 38.3 per cent from KSh 113.2 billion in 2015/16 to KSh 156.5 billion in 2016/17. Total development expenditure is expected to grow by 31.7 per cent from KSh 87.8 billion in 2015/16 to KSh 115.6 billion in 2016/17. Development expenditure on trunk and primary roads is expected to grow by 36.2 per cent from KSh 51.6 billion in 2015/16 to KSh 70.3 billion in 2016/17. Disbursement of funds from the Roads Maintenance Levy Fund (RMLF) by Kenya Roads Board (KRB) to various road agencies and county governments is expected to increase significantly to KSh 40.9 billion in 2016/17 from KSh 25.4 billion in 2015/16. Cumulative expenditure on SGR stood at KSh 295.7 billion as end of 2016. The government spent KSh 180.7 billion in 2016 compared to KSh 106.5 billion spent in 2015. 12.3. On development of housing, the National Housing Corporation (NHC), undertook a number of housing activities in three counties; Nairobi, Kisumu and Kisii in 2016, at a cost of KSh 328.7 million, KSh 439.7 million and KSh 109.5 million, respectively. The value of reported new buildings completed in Nairobi registered a growth of 7.6 per cent to stand at KSh 76.2 billion in 2016. The value of reported building plans approved increased by 43.3 per cent from KSh 215.2 billion in 2015 to KSh 308.4 billion in 2016. The value of reported building works completed was 24.7 per cent of the approved building plans in 2016, compared to 32.9 per cent in 2015. The value of public buildings completed increased significantly from KSh 61.5 million in 2015 to KSh 3.8 billion in 2016. The value of new private buildings in Nairobi City County went up by 7.5 per cent from KSh 70.9 billion in 2015 to KSh 76.2 billion in 2016, on account of continued increase in construction of both residential and non- residential buildings. Key Economic 12.4. Table 12.1 presents selected key economic indicators in the building and construction Indicators sector for the period 2012 to 2016. The index of Government expenditure on roads increased from 350.3 in 2015 to 461.0 in 2016 following an increase in road construction projects.

      "Chapter 12: Building and Construction 12 Building and Construction Chapter Overview The Government has continued in its efforts to develop efficient and effective infrastructure, which is a key enabler for other sectors as envisaged in Kenya Vision 2030. An improved road network enhances connectivity, mobility and promotes trade and investments by reducing cost of doing business. Significant progress has been made in the construction of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR). In addition, the construction of roads across major towns such as Nairobi and Kisumu gives impetus to the Government’s commitment to developing infrastructure to promote business. The construction industry grew by 9.2 per cent in 2016 from an expansion of 13.9 per cent registered in 2015. Increased activity in the construction of roads and development of housing also translated to an increase in employment in the sector from 148.6 thousand jobs in 2015 to 163.0 thousand jobs in 2016. 12.2. Overall expenditure on roads is expected to increase by 38.3 per cent from KSh 113.2 billion in 2015/16 to KSh 156.5 billion in 2016/17. Total development expenditure is expected to grow by 31.7 per cent from KSh 87.8 billion in 2015/16 to KSh 115.6 billion in 2016/17. Development expenditure on trunk and primary roads is expected to grow by 36.2 per cent from KSh 51.6 billion in 2015/16 to KSh 70.3 billion in 2016/17. Disbursement of funds from the Roads Maintenance Levy Fund (RMLF) by Kenya Roads Board (KRB) to various road agencies and county governments is expected to increase significantly to KSh 40.9 billion in 2016/17 from KSh 25.4 billion in 2015/16. Cumulative expenditure on SGR stood at KSh 295.7 billion as end of 2016. The government spent KSh 180.7 billion in 2016 compared to KSh 106.5 billion spent in 2015. 12.3. On development of housing, the National Housing Corporation (NHC), undertook a number of housing activities in three counties; Nairobi, Kisumu and Kisii in 2016, at a cost of KSh 328.7 million, KSh 439.7 million and KSh 109.5 million, respectively. The value of reported new buildings completed in Nairobi registered a growth of 7.6 per cent to stand at KSh 76.2 billion in 2016. The value of reported building plans approved increased by 43.3 per cent from KSh 215.2 billion in 2015 to KSh 308.4 billion in 2016. The value of reported building works completed was 24.7 per cent of the approved building plans in 2016, compared to 32.9 per cent in 2015. The value of public buildings completed increased significantly from KSh 61.5 million in 2015 to KSh 3.8 billion in 2016. The value of new private buildings in Nairobi City County went up by 7.5 per cent from KSh 70.9 billion in 2015 to KSh 76.2 billion in 2016, on account of continued increase in construction of both residential and non- residential buildings. Key Economic 12.4. Table 12.1 presents selected key economic indicators in the building and construction Indicators sector for the period 2012 to 2016. The index of Government expenditure on roads increased from 350.3 in 2015 to 461.0 in 2016 following an increase in road construction projects. The index of reported private building works completed in Nairobi City County rose from 369.4 in 2015 to 407.1 in 2016. Similarly, the index of reported public building works completed in major towns registered an increase from 112.6 in 2015 to 138.9 in 2016. Consumption of cement, a major input in construction of buildings and civil works, rose further by 10.5 per cent from 5,708.8 thousand tonnes in 2015 to 6,302.0 thousand tonnes in 2016.

Twenty seven counties benefited from the Roads 2000 Programme, with a total of 1,416.9 kilometers, earmarked for construction under this programme by December 2016 at an estimated cost of KSh 57.6 billion. 204"

Container Freight Stations (CFS) provide additional storage space for containerized cargo at the Port of Mombasa. The number of Container Freight Stations increased from 12 in 2015 to 15 in 2016. Developments Kenya Pipeline Company in the Transport 14.31. In 2016, Kenya Pipeline Company completed a 122km 10-inch pipeline parallel to and Storage the existing 6-inch pipeline from Sinendet to Kisumu (Line 3). This pipeline is expected to sector enhance availability of petroleum products in the Western Kenya and the export market. The benefits of the project include; increased product flow to Kisumu depot by 350 cubic metres per hour, optimization of tank utilization and opening up development of other projects such as the Kisumu Oil Jetty (KOJ) and Kisumu – Busia Pipeline. 14.32. The other major infrastructural achievement in the review period was the construction of additional tanks in Nairobi Terminal. The new tanks are expected to enhance storage capacity from 100,000 to 233,000 cubic metres. The new tanks will provide sufficient capacity for receipt of higher volumes of products expected, once the Mombasa – Nairobi pipeline is replaced. The project to expand storage capacity in the Nairobi Terminal by 133,000 cubic metres is currently ongoing and is expected to be completed by June 2017. Upon completion, the project is anticipated to enhance operational flexibility and increase tank turnaround for Kipevu Oil Storage Facility while guaranteeing security of supply. The Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) 14.33. The Government has continued to implement major infrastructural developments on the various modes of transport aimed at easing the flow of people and goods across the country and beyond. The Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) is one such project. 14.34. Phase 1 of the SGR from Mombasa to Nairobi is nearly complete with all the line completed 18 months ahead of time. Currently, two stations, Mombasa and Nairobi, have been completed. The inland container deport (dry port) in Embakasi has been expanded to cater for the anticipated increase in container traffic. Throughput at the Port of Mombasa currently stands at an estimated 22 million Twenty Equivalent Units (TEUs’). Forty per cent of this traffic is expected to be offloaded to the SGR once it commences operations and is anticipated to grow in volume in tandem with the growth in port throughput to an estimated 15.5 million TEUs’ by 2022. 14.35. The SGR is expected to be commissioned on 1st June, 2017, upon which operations will commence. Towards this realization, work is ongoing to test the operations. Rail freight from Mombasa to Nairobi is expected to take eight hours with the locomotives moving at a speed of 80 km/h while the time taken for movement of passengers is expected to reduce to four and a half hours with locomotives moving at a speed of 120 km/h over the same distance. Phase II of the SGR from Nairobi to Naivasha is also on course. Route identification for this second phase of the project as well as identification of the Project Affected Persons (PAP) have been done. The National Land Commission (NLC) is currently doing valuation of the land in a bid to relocate people from the identified route. The Contractor is expected to start work by July or August, 2017. The Government has secured funding of up to 150 million USD from the EXIM Bank of China. 235",

Mobile Network Services: Mobile telephone capacity expanded by 14.0 per cent from 62.8 million in 2015 to 71.6 million in 2016 mainly on account of strong demand for mobile services. Mobile subscriptions increased from 37.7 million in 2015 to 39.0 million in 2016. The number of mobile money subscribers increased by 19.6 per cent to 32.0 million in 2016 while the value of funds sent via mobile money platform increased by 19.2 per cent to KSh 3.4 trillion in 2016. Similarly, the number of mobile money transactions grew by 37.0 per cent from 1,114.2 million in 2015 to 1,526.2 million in 2016. During the review period, the country recorded 928.2 thousand mobile commerce (m-commerce) transactions with a value of KSh 1.8 trillion.

The total international telephone traffic increased from 1,173 million minutes in 2015 to 1,196 million minutes in 2016. The slow growth in international telephone traffic can mainly be attributed to the increased competition from “over the top” services and social media during the review period. Outgoing international telephone traffic decreased by 11.4 per cent to 482.5 million minutes in 2016 while international incoming telephone traffic increased by 13.6 per cent to 714 million minutes during the same period. 15.7. Data on the international telephone traffic through fixed line shows a continuous decline for both incoming and outgoing calls over the last five years as shown in Figure 15.1. This was partly due to the decline in fixed line subscriptions over time. During the period under review, outgoing international fixed telephone traffic decreased by 9.3 per cent while incoming traffic decreased by 3.8 per cent. Outgoing international traffic for mobile telephones declined by 11.4 per cent. Incoming international traffic through the mobile telephony however increased by 13.9 per cent in 2016. The decline in international outgoing traffic through mobile telephony was partly due to the high cost of making international calls in some foreign countries and preference of using instant messaging applications. 15.8. Roaming Voice Traffic: Total roaming voice traffic increased by 36.3 per cent from 194.8 million minutes recorded in 2015 to 265.6 million minutes in 2016. Outbound roaming traffic increased by 57.4 per cent to stand at 143.5 million minutes while inbound roaming grew by 17.8 per cent to stand at 122.0 million minutes in 2016. Figure 15.2 shows trends in international outbound and inbound roaming for the period 2012 to 2016. The upward trend observed for outbound traffic was partly due to the reduced roaming rates within the East African Community. Similary, the rise in inbound traffic can partly be attributed to the high- level meetings hosted in the country over the review period. 238",

The total number of messages sent via Short Messaging Services (SMS) increased by Services 63.6 per cent to 46.3 billion in 2016 compared to 28.3 billion messages in 2015. This growth Traffic was mainly driven by domestic messages which increased by 63.7 per cent during the review period. The vigorous promotions carried out by operators, such as providing plans to customers to create their own SMS bundles, which allow one to send numerous texts at minimal costs further explains the upsurge. However, international messages declined substantially with those received dropping by 29.4 per cent from 131.1 million in 2015 to 38.5 million in 2016. Similarly, international SMSs sent decreased by 6.3 per cent to 36.8 million in 2016. The downward trend observed in Figure 15.4 has been attributed to competition from instant messaging applications that are cheaper.

Media Frequencies and Subscriptions: Information on media frequencies and Frequencies mobile transceivers for the period 2012 to 2016 is presented in Table 15.9. The number of TV and Mobile frequencies increased from 302 recorded in 2015 to 312 in 2016. The increase was attributed Transceivers to the spread of digital TV broadcasting, which requires less bandwidth than similar analogue broadcasting thereby freeing some bandwidth for more frequencies. The number of radio FM frequencies also increased by 79 to stand at 687 in 2016. The number of free to air TV channels on the digital terrestrial platform increased slightly to 63 while digital signal distributors remained unchanged. 15.19. Mobile Transceivers: The total number of mobile transceivers grew by 12.9 per cent from 109,294 in 2015 to 123,380 in 2016. The third generation (3G) increased by 59.7 per cent to 30,818 while the second generation (2G) rose by 2.9 per cent to 92,562 during the review period. The substantial increase in the 3G mobile transceivers resulted from extension of the third-generation network to several towns during the review period.

Gender Equality in ICT: Table 15.13 presents data on gender equality in ICT for the period 2012 to 2016. Globally, the need for gender ICT statistics has been widely discussed and affirmed in many forums, including the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) and in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Gender related statistics in ICT are important in identifying the variations in access to and use of ICT by men and women in order to inform national and international policy goals that are a prerequisite for the achievement of an equitable information society.

The reforms included; vetting of police officers, installation of a national secure communication network and surveillance system for the National Police Service (NPS) in Nairobi and Mombasa, and introduction of a ‘Roadmap Toolkit’ to guide the training of police officers. The toolkit comprise of new Service Standing Orders, regulations on the use of force and the use of firearms, and strategies to counter corruption in the police service. During the same period, additional armored vehicles as well as transport trucks were procured to enhance capacity of the police to respond to emerging security threats and improve police mobility. 16.2. During the review period, the Judiciary implemented various reforms which were aimed at promoting socio-economic development. Among them was the operationalization of Employment and Labour Relations Court, formerly the Industrial Court, and the Environment and Land Court to High Court status. The Judiciary also established the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Division in the High Court that is dedicated to hearing and determining corruption and economic crime cases. At the same time, the department of Immigration rolled out Electronic Foreign Nationals Services (eFNS) portal used by foreign nationals to apply for entry documents, work permits, citizenship and permanent residence. 16.3. The number of crimes reported to the police increased by 6.2 per cent from 72,490 in 2015 to 76,986 in 2016. Offences against persons and stealing were the main types of crimes reported in 2016 and accounted for 29.0 per cent and 13.5 per cent of crimes reported, respectively.

The crucial role of MSMEs is underscored in Kenya’s Vision 2030, which is the development blueprint which seeks to transform Kenya into an industrialized middle-income country, providing a high quality life to all its citizens by the year 2030. The MSME sector has been identified and prioritized as a key growth driver for achievement of the development blue print. 18.2. Micro, Small and Medium Establishments (MSMEs) survey adopted Kenya’s official definition where MSMEs are defined according to employment size; Micro enterprises (less than 10 employees); Small enterprises (10 to 49 employees); Medium sized enterprises (50 to 99 employees). The main indicators targeted by the survey included: number of establishments in the country; distribution of MSMEs by sex of owners; level of innovation in the sector; education qualifications and training; persons engaged in the MSMEs sector; comparison of MSMEs to national value added; financing of MSMEs operations; MSMEs expenditure structure; constraints faced by MSMEs; prevalence for closure of businesses; reasons for business closures; and disposal of stock after business closure.
