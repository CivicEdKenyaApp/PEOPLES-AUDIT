Below are observations to be taken into account when using the statistics in Economic Survey 2016. Data sources The statistics presented in Economic Survey 2016 are based on a wide variety of sources. In order to provide the most comprehensive picture of the economy and social situation in Kenya during 2015, KNBS gathers data from surveys, surveys and censuses and obtains administrative data from Ministries, Government Departments and Agencies. The source of the data is always noted directly alongside the table or in the explanatory text. More details about the data may be obtained from the responsible primary data source agency. Accuracy and reliability The surveys carried out by KNBS are primarily based on samples of the population. Although the sample surveys are representative of the total units, in some instances, sampling errors may occur. Other non-sampling errors may also exist, such as respondent fatigue (when respondents do not answer a questionnaire, either fully or partially). However, the Surveys conducted by KNBS always based on international standards and methods, and mitigation measures are always taken to minimize errors. Whenever such errors occur, they are documented appropriately and shared widely. Data from administrative sources may also be subject to certain errors, such as undercoverage in the source (where it has not been possible to collect data) and differences in definitions and categorization. Periodicity Some of the data presented cover the calendar year (e.g. 2015) and some cover financial years, (e.g. from July 2014 to June 2015, presented as 2014/15). Where necessary, the period covered by the data is specified in the table and/or the explanatory text. Consistency Where data is available, KNBS has endeavoured to provide statistical tables that are comparable over time. In terms of consistency between data, some definitions and categories, such as age groups, may differ due to varying data sources. Data Revision It should be noted that extensive minor revisions of the macroeconomic data has continued in 2015 in order to capture in the published figures the most recent picture of the economy, in partcular there are some changes in the 2013 and 2014 data. Accessibility Economic Survey reports, including this edition, are uploaded on KNBS´website for download free-of-charge in pdf format. The publication is also available in hard copy from KNBS at a small fee. Further details on the data are available from respective Directorates in KNBS. iv",

World current account balance as a percentage of GDP stood at 0.3 per cent in 2015 relative to 0.4 per cent in 2014. Global inflation rate eased from 3.5 per cent in 2014 to 3.3 per cent in 2015 as a result of decline in international oil and other commodity prices. Total global unemployment stood at 197.1 million in 2015. The world merchandise trade volume grew by 3.2 per cent. The advanced economies experienced a modest economic recovery, mainly driven by stronger domestic demand as labour markets and credit conditions improved. Emerging markets and developing economies experienced low commodity prices, weaker capital flows, subdued global trade and increasing financial market volatility. The economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) slowed from 5.1 per cent in 2014 to 3.8 per cent in 2015. Similarly there was a slowed growth of 3.4 per cent for the East Africa Community mainly associated with political instability in Burundi and uncertainties associated with general elections in Tanzania and Uganda. Domestic Economy The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.6 per cent in 2015 compared to 5.3 per cent growth in 2014. This expansion was as a result of significant growth in some key sectors among them agriculture; construction; real estate; and financial and insurance. However, growths in mining and quarrying; information and communication; and wholesale and retail trade decelerated during the same period. Accommodation and food services was the only sector whose growth contracted by 1.3 per cent which was however an improvement from the previous year decline of 16.7 per cent. Key macroeconomic indicators remained relatively stable during the review period. Overall, inflation eased from 6.9 per cent in 2014 to 6.6 per cent in 2015 due to lower energy and transport prices. The current account deficit as a percentage of GDP narrowed from 14.5 per cent in 2014 to 11.4 per cent in 2015. This was due to a substantial growth in export of goods and services and a reduction in the import bill. The Kenyan Shilling depreciated against its major trading currencies during the review period but appreciated against the Euro, South Africa Rand and the Japanese Yen, respectively. Despite the monetary authorities adjusting the Central Bank rate (CBR), the weighted average interest rates on commercial banks loans and advances rose by 1.40 percentage points to 17.45 per cent in December 2015 compared to a rise of 15.99 per cent in December 2014. The volume of stocks traded at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) declined significantly from a high of 5,346 points in the first quarter of 2015 to 4,040 points in December 2015. Social Scene During the period under review, the National Government expenditure on social sector is expected to continue increasing as a result of the demand for basic social services by the population. National Government total expenditure on the social sector is expected to increase by 19.8 per cent to KSh 430.1 billion in 2015/16. The recurrent expenditure is expected to increase from KSh 309.8 billion in 2014/15 to KSh 359.4 billion in 2015/16. Development 1",

This was as a result of increased credit to the National Government that rose to KSh 538.0 billion as at December 2015 compared to KSh 424.9 billion as at December 2014. Credit to the private sector including other public bodies also expanded by 17.5 per cent in the review period to reach KSh 2,292.4 billion. Broad money supply M3 grew by 14.1 per cent in 2015 to KSh 2,658.2 billion compared to an expansion of 16.7 per cent in 2014. Interest rates recorded mixed performance with spikes and dips for most nominal rates in 2015. The Commercial banks’ Loans-Deposit interest rate spread rose from 9.18 percentage points in December 2014 to 9.53 percentage points in December 2015. The capital market performance was depressed in 2015. The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) 20-Share index recorded a high of 5,346 points during the first quarter of the year but dipped to 4,040 points in December 2015, representing a drop of 21.0 per cent compared to December 2014. The total number of shares traded during the review period also went down to 6,812 million from 8,134 million reported in 2014. Public Finance The fiscal plan in 2015/16 entailed a deliberate effort to continue exercising prudence in public expenditure management with the principal goal of containing fiscal risks, gradually lower the fiscal deficit, and contain growth of recurrent expenditures in favor of productive capital spending. To achieve this, the Government endeavoured to accelerate spending in infrastructure, agriculture, security, health, education, social protection and youth empowerment. The overall objective of this will be to realise sustainable, shared and equitable growth that would in return lead to job creation. Against this backdrop, the National Government budget estimates for 2015/16 amounts to KSh 2,224.0 billion, an increase from KSh 1,950.7 billion spent in 2014/15. Total recurrent expenditure is estimated at KSh 1,238.2 billon, while development expenditure is expected to grow by 22.8 per cent to KSh 985.8 billion. In 2015/16, total recurrent revenue is estimated to register a 26.6 per cent growth to stand at KSh 1,401.2 billion, out of which tax revenue will account for 92.0 per cent. Total stock of debt as at end of 2014/15 stood at KSh 2,601.4 billion, of which external debt stock accounted for 54.7 per cent. Debt servicing charges net of repayments from on lending are expected to stand at KSh 399.0 billion. During the period under review,KSh 259.8 billion will be transferred to county Governments. The total budgeted expenditure for county Governments is estimated at KSh 361.1 billion against an estimated revenue of KSh 343.7 billion. International Trade and Balance of Payments Total exports rose by 8.2 per cent to KSh 581 billion in 2015, while total imports declined by 2.5 per cent to KSh 1,578 billion. This resulted to the balance of trade improving from a deficit of KSh 1,081 billion in 2014 to a deficit of KSh 997 billion. The volume of trade increased marginally from KSh 2,156 billion in 2014 to KSh 2,158 billion in 2015. The rise in the total export earnings compared to the decline in the total import bill led to the improvement of export-import ratio from 33.2 per cent in 2014 to 36.8 per cent in 2015. Terms of trade of all items improved from 73.1 per cent in 2014 to 84.9 per cent in 2015, mainly due to improved unit prices of the export commodities coupled with a decline in import prices of mineral fuels.

The balance of payments position deteriorated from a surplus of KSh 128 billion in 2014 to a deficit of KSh 25 billion in 2015 largely attributed to repayments of external loans. The current account balance improved by 19.5 per cent to a deficit of KSh 425 billion from a deficit of KSh 526 billion in 2014, as a result of a 7.4 per cent increase in merchandise exports. The financial account net inflows recorded a surplus of KSh 616 billion in 2014 compared to a surplus of KSh 498 billion in 2015. Agriculture Performance of the agricultural sector in 2015 improved against a backdrop of good weather and abundant rainfall, hence Gross Value Added improved from 3.5 per cent in 2014 to 6.2 per cent in 2015. This was largely achieved through improved crop and livestock production over the review period. Maize production increased by 9.0 per cent from 39.0 million bags in 2014 to 42.5 million bags in 2015. Sugar cane production increased by 4.6 per cent from 6.5 million tonnes in 2014 to 6.8 million tonnes in 2015. The quantity of horticultural exports increased by 8.4 per cent from 220.2 thousand tonnes in 2014 to 238.7 thousand tonnes in 2015. Export earnings from horticulture rose by 7.6 per cent to KSh 90.4 billion in 2015. The volume of marketed milk increased by 10.9 per cent from 541.3 million litres in 2014 to 600.4 million litres in 2015. Earnings from milk sales during the review period rose by 10.0 per cent to KSh 20.7 billion in 2015. However, tea production declined by 10.3 per cent from 445.1 thousand tonnes in 2014 to 399.1 thousand tonnes in 2015. However, the crop earnings increased by 39.5 per cent from KSh 84.9 billion in 2014 to KSh 118.4 billion in 2015. Coffee production declined by 16.0 per cent from 49.5 thousand tonnes in 2013/14 to 41.6 thousand tonnes in 2014/15. Coffee earnings also declined from KSh 16.6 billion in 2014 to KSh 12.1 billion in 2015. Overall, the food supply situation as monitored through the Food Balance Sheet improved as reflected in the energy supply improving from 2,202 Kilo Calories in 2014 to 2,293 kilo calories in 2015. The Self Sufficiency Ratio (SSR) improved from 74.4 per cent in 2014 to 75.2 per cent in 2015. The Import Dependency Ratio also improved slightly from 29.2 per cent in 2014 to 28.3 per cent in 2015. Environment and Natural Resources The Government continued to review and enforce policy measures that govern the exploitation, management and conservation of the environment and natural resources. During the review period, the Environment Management and Co-ordination Act 2015 (Amendment) was enacted to facilitate effective management of the environment and natural resources.

Total value of fish output decreased from KSh 22.4 billion in 2014 to KSh 22.2 billion in 2015, mainly on account of reduced fish landings. The overall value of mineral output rose by 14.7 per cent from KSh 21.1 billion in 2014 to 24.2 billion in 2015.

In 2015, Rural Electrification Authority financed electricity supply to a total of 21,487 public primary schools, 17,809 on grid and 3,678 on solar. Manufacturing The sector’s real output grew by 3.5 per cent in 2015 compared to a slower growth of 3.2 per cent in 2014. This was attributed to reduced production costs arising from lower cost of petroleum and electricity inputs. The manufacturing quantum index recorded a slower growth of 3.9 per cent in 2015 compared to 6.3 per cent registered in 2014. This increase was mainly driven by increased production of pharmaceutical products; beverages; meat and meat products; and non-metallic minerals and plastic products. Producer Price Index (PPI) increased by 3.91 per cent in 2015 compared to an increase of 3.03 in 2014, mainly due to high cost of imported raw materials arising from depreciation of the Kenya Shilling against major currencies.

Formal employment in the sector rose by 2.7 per cent from 287.4 thousand persons in 2014 to 295.4 thousand persons in 2015. The Export Processing Zone (EPZ) program recorded improved performance in employment, exports, imports, and expenditure on local goods and services, with total sales increasing by 12.1 per cent to KSh 64.1 billion in 2015.

The number of licensed Internet Service Providers (ISPs) increased from 177 in 2014 to 221 in 2015. Data speed for computer modems and transmission carriers increased by 66.9 per cent to 20,293 bits per second per capita (BPs/person) owing to accessibility of fiber optic. The international telephone traffic increased by 11.4 per cent to 1,173 million minutes. Similarly, domestic telephone calls traffic increased by 27.7 per cent to 39.2 billion minutes in 2015. The number of messages sent via Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS) rose by 13.9 per cent to 13.7 million in 2015 while of Short Messaging Services (SMS) increased by 3.3 per cent. The number of international SMS received declined by 19.0 per cent to 131.1 million in 2015. The number of mobile money transfer service subscribers grew to 26.8 million in 2015. Total amount of money transacted through mobile money platform expanded by 18.7 per cent to KSh 2,816 billion over the review period. Governance The Governance, Justice, Law and Order sector recorded improved performance in service delivery in the year 2015. The Kenya Police Service was bolstered with the commissioning of the national surveillance, communication control system in Nairobi and Mombasa, procurement of armoured Police vehicles and recruitment of more officers. The Judiciary recruited more judicial officers and opened up more court stations. In the year under review, crimes reported to the police increased by 4.5 per cent to 72,490 cases while persons reported to the police to have committed crimes decreased by 8.3 per cent from 34,561 in 2014 to 31,695 in 2015. Cases filed in courts decreased from 500,349 in 2014 to 330,553 in 2015 with cases disposed of declined by about 31 per cent to 247,743. However, pending cases grew by 13.6 per cent to 693,100 in 2015. The number of judicial officers increased from 623 in 2014 to 666. Prison population declined by 10.6 per cent from 248,390 in 2014 to 221,974 in 2015. Daily Average Prison Population (DAP) decreased from 55,270 to 54,631 inmates during the year under review. The number of offenders serving probation and community service orders increased by 13.4 per cent to 13,422 and 27.5 per cent 43,380 respectively. Cases handled by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission increased from 4,013 in 2014 to 5,551. The Commission traced assets worth KSh 3,900 million and actualized recoveries valued at KSh 140 million. New identity cards produced in 2015 were 816,477 compared to 738,064 in 2014. In 2015 a total of 764,445 identity cards were collected, compared to 709,573 in 2014. Outlook The performance of Kenya’s economy in 2016 is likely to be determined largely by internal factors. However, exogenous factors will also shape the economy but probably to a lesser extent. Generally, all the sectors of the economy are expected to continue in their current growth trajectory.

Against this background, agriculture sector’s output is likely to slowdown but record a moderate positive growth. Similarly, the manufacturing sector is also likely to be supported by lower fuel prices and improved supply of electricity as well as sustained delivery of inputs from the agriculture sector. 7",

    "text": "Summary and Outlook The financial intermediation sector is likely to remain robust despite the recent takeover of three commercial banks by the Central Bank of Kenya due to financial impropriety. The expected sustenance of growth momentum by most of the economic activities is likely to boost credit uptake and therefore favour the financial and insurance activities. The construction industry is also expected to maintain an increased role in the creation of value addition due to the ongoing public infrastructure development and continued investment in fixed assets by the private sector. Fuel prices are expected to remain at around the level experienced during the first quarter of 2016 and therefore help contain inflation within the Central Bank’s target. The Kenya shilling is likely to remain stable against its major trading currencies similar to all other key macroeconomic indicators. The value of Kenya’s import of goods is likely to decline further mainly due to low international oil prices. On the other hand, export earnings are expected to grow in line with a projected growth of world merchandise trade in 2016. The current account deficit will most probably narrow further due to the expected slowdown in imports. 8",

This was as a result of low commodity prices, weaker capital flows, subdued global trade and increasing financial market volatility particularly in emerging markets and developing economies. However, the advanced economies experienced a modest economic recovery, mainly driven by stronger domestic demand as labour markets and credit conditions improved. 1.2. The economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) slowed from 5.1 per cent GDP growth in 2014 to 3.8 per cent growth in 2015. This was attributed to the weak global economic growth and lower commodity prices. However, there was a slowed growth of 3.4 per cent in 2015 from 5.8 per cent in 2014 in the East Africa Community (EAC). This was mainly associated with political instability in Burundi and uncertainties associated with general election in Tanzania and Uganda. The devastating impact of Ebola in some West African countries was reflected in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) growth that decelerated to 4.0 per cent in 2015 compared to 6.0 per cent in 2014. 1.3. Global inflation rate eased from 3.5 per cent in 2014 to 3.3 per cent in 2015. This was attributed to a decline in international oil and other commodity prices. High supplies and weak demand for commodities contributed to the lowering of most commodity prices. Lower crude oil prices caused by sluggish demand were driven by expectations of slowing global growth particularly in the emerging markets and developing economies. Similarly, the revolution in technology in the United States (US) and Canada led to increased global oil production. This led to a reduction in the import of oil in the US, thereby contributing to the fall in oil prices. The Murban ADNOC crude oil price averaged at $52.53 per barrel in 2015, a decline from $ 99.46 per barrel in 2014. 1.4. The world merchandise trade volume grew by 3.2 per cent in 2015 compared to an increase of 3.3 per cent in 2014. This performance was due to a slump in import volumes in both emerging markets and developing economies, reflecting both weaker demand in growth and reduction in the intensity of imports. 1.5. Despite narrowing of the global current account imbalances, current account deficits remained relatively high in many economies. World current account balance stood at 0.3 per cent of GDP in 2015 relative to 0.4 per cent of GDP in 2014. However, SSA’s current account balance recorded a deficit of 5.7 per cent in 2015 compared to a deficit of 2.6 per cent of GDP in 2014. This was on account of reduced export revenues, especially for the commodity exports. The emerging markets and developing economies current account balance recorded a surplus of 0.1 per cent of the GDP in 2015. 1.6. OECD countries fiscal deficits improved from 3.8 per cent of GDP in 2014 to 3.3 per cent in 2015. High fiscal deficits in SSA economies were due to falling commodity prices, geopolitical tensions, rising infrastructural spending and construction of mining projects. 1.7.

The OECD’s real GDP grew by 2.0 per cent in 2015 compared to a growth of 1.9 per cent in 2014. This was mainly attributed to improvements in economic performance in Japan and Euro Area. Inflation rate eased to 0.8 per cent in 2015 compared to 1.7 per cent recorded in 2014. This was as a result of drop in inflation rate in all the selected OECD countries. Current account surplus as a percentage of GDP improved for the second consecutive year to 0.2 per cent in 2015 compared to 0.0 per cent increase in 2014. This could be explained by improvement in current account of all selected OECD countries except USA. Euro Area 1.9. Real GDP in the Euro Area went up by 1.5 per cent in 2015 compared to a growth of 0.9 per cent recorded in 2014. The modest growth was supported by both domestic demand and exports. Inflation rate within the region eased to 0.1 per cent in 2015 compared to 0.4 per cent in 2014, mainly due to the decline in fuel prices. Unemployment rate improved to 10.9 per cent in 2015 compared to 11.5 per cent in 2014. Current account surplus as a percentage of GDP improved from 3.3 per cent in 2014 to 3.8 per cent in 2015. United States of America 1.10. The economic growth of USA in real terms remained unchanged at 2.4 per cent in 2015 mainly supported by robust consumer spending and investment in the non-oil private sector. Current account deficit as a percentage of GDP worsened to 2.5 per cent in 2015 compared to a deficit of 2.2 per cent in 2014. This was attributed to strengthening of the US Dollar and weakening external demand that weighed on exports and manufacturing activities. Solid labour market conditions and the dynamic investment in non-oil private sector led to an improvement in unemployment rate from 6.2 per cent in 2014 to 5.3 per cent in 2015. United Kingdom 1.11.

The economic performance of the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa (BRIICS) decelerated for the second consecutive year in 2015 as shown in Table 1.2. Average real GDP in the BRIICS recorded a growth of 2.2 per cent in 2015 compared to an increase of 3.4 per cent in 2014. This was mainly attributed to underperformance of the economies of Brazil, Russia and China. However, inflation rate worsened from 6.0 per cent in 2014 to 7.2 per cent in 2015. The current account balance improved from a deficit of 1.7 per cent in 2014 to a deficit of 0.7 per cent in 2015. 1.15. Real GDP growth of Brazil worsened to a contraction of 3.0 per cent compared to a growth of 0.3 per cent in 2014. This was a reflection of the recession caused by political uncertainty that resulted to low economic confidence. Inflation increased to 8.9 per cent in 2015 compared to 6.3 per cent rate in 2014. Real GDP growth of Russia, contracted by 3.8 per cent in 2015 compared to a marginal growth of 0.2 per cent in 2014. This was attributed to lower oil prices, international sanctions and capital flight that reduced investment, domestic consumption and imports. The large depreciation of the Russian currency (ruble) pushed inflation to double digits, from 7.4 per cent in 2014 to 15.8 per cent over the year under review. 1.16. China’s economy grew by 6.8 per cent in 2015 compared to 7.4 per cent in 2014. This was explained by slowdown in the manufacturing sector and decline in real estate investment that recorded large unsold inventories. The financial market turbulence in China led to capital flight that significantly affected all the BRIICS countries except India. The economy of India recorded a significant real GDP growth of 7.3 per cent in 2015 compared to growth of 5.6 per cent in 2014. This was driven by increased consumption and public investment. In Indonesia, real GDP grew by 4.7 per cent in 2015, a slower growth compared to 5.2 per cent growth in 2014. During the year under review, South Africa’s economy grew by 1.4 per cent, similarly to that recorded in 2014. However, the economy was affected by strikes in the mining sector, continued electricity shortages that hampered the manufacturing sector and severe drought that reduced the agricultural production in 2015. The decline in global oil prices eased inflation from 6.3 per cent in 2014 to 4.8 per cent in 2015. Association of South Eastern Asia Nations 1.17. The average real GDP of the Association of South Eastern Asia Nations (ASEAN-5) grew by 4.6 per cent in 2015 compared to growth of 4.8 per cent in 2014. This was attributed to reduced external demand resulting from a slowdown in economic performance in China. Inflation in the region dropped to 3.0 per cent in 2015 compared to 4.1 per cent in 2014 mainly due to lower food and oil prices. Current account surplus as a percentage of GDP grew by 1.3 per cent during the year under review compared to 2.3 per cent growth in 2014. Sub-Saharan Africa 1.18. Economic growth in the SSA slowed from 5.1 per cent in 2014 to an estimated 3.8 per cent in 2015. The slowdown in the economic performance was attributed to a decline in the prices of the main commodities and weak global economic performance. Inflation rate in the region worsened from 6.7 per cent in 2014 to 7.8 per cent in 2015. This was mainly due to depreciation in value of currencies of the region’s major economies. The current account deficit as a percentage of GDP worsened from a contraction of 2.6 per cent in 2014 to a contraction 5.7 per cent in 2015. 13",

The Southern African Development Community (SADC) recorded a slowed growth of 3.0 per cent in 2015 compared to a 3.2 per cent growth in 2014. This was mainly due to constant economic growth registered in South Africa. Inflation rate improved to 5.6 per cent in 2015 compared to 6.3 per cent in 2014, explained by decline in global oil prices. The region’s current account widened to a deficit of 6.6 per cent in 2015 from a deficit of 5.4 per cent in 2014. Maghreb 1.21. Real GDP growth in Maghreb region grew from a contraction of 0.6 per cent in 2014 to 1.4 per cent in 2015. The performance was associated with improved Euro Area economic growth that raised export demand, tourism, and remittances. In Libya, real GDP improved from a contraction of 19.8 per cent in 2014 to 6.1 per cent in 2015. The improved performance resulted from increased fiscal revenues from oil exports. Inflation in the region worsened from 3.6 per cent in 2014 to 4.4 per cent in 2015. Current account as a percentage of GDP worsened to a deficit 21.8 per cent in 2015, from a deficit of 14.3 per cent in 2014. Outlook 1.22. On the global perspective, real GDP is projected to grow by 3.6 per cent in 2016. This growth is predicted on continuous gains in major high-income countries, a gradual tightening of financing conditions especially in the USA, a stabilization of commodity prices, and a gradual economic rebalancing in China. Global trade is also projected to grow by 3.6 per cent in 2016, rising broadly in line with global output growth. 1.23. In the OECD economies, real GDP is projected to grow by 2.2 per cent in 2016. Euro Area economic performance is projected to grow by 1.8 per cent in 2016. This is due to the expected improvements in credit growth and a decline in unemployment. Similarly, real GDP growth in the emerging economies of BRIICS is projected to grow by 3.1 per cent in 2016. 1.24. Growth in SSA is projected to increase by 4.3 per cent in 2016, on the account of commodity prices stabilization and decline infrastructure constraints. Real GDP in the EAC region is projected to grow to 6.6 per cent in 2016. Lower commodity prices and high expected investment costs are projected to increase the risk of delaying investments particularly in energy and mining sectors in the region. 1.25. The ongoing economic rebalancing in China is expected to create external demand in Asia and BRIICS. These regions are expected to register growth in real GDP of 4.9 and contraction of 0.6 per cent in 2016. Real GDP in Maghreb countries is expected to remain robust with a projected growth of 3.8 per cent.

This growth was mainly supported by a stable macroeconomic environment and improvement in outputs of agriculture; construction; finance and insurance and real estate. However, growth slowed in a number of sectors including; information and communication, mining and quarrying, and wholesale and retail trade. Similarly, growth in taxes on products slowed during the review period. The growth of accommodation and food services contracted by 1.3 per cent,a less severe performance compared to a revised decline of 16.7 per cent in 2014. 2.2. The growth in agriculture was mainly supported by improved weather condition that resulted in significant increases in output of maize, horticultural produce and livestock. However, heavy rains in 2015 were unfavorable to cultivation of some crops like potatoes and tomatoes. Nevertheless the significance of crops that were favoured by the weather far outweighed that of crops negatively impacted upon, resulting in an impressive growth of 5.6 per cent in the agriculture sector. Construction recorded the fastest growth of 13.6 per cent in 2015 compared to 13.1 per cent in 2014. Growth in construction activities was mainly driven by the ongoing public infrastructure development coupled with the resilient private sector’s expansion in the real estate sector. The financial and insurance sector maintained a robust expansion to grow at 8.7 per cent in 2015 from 8.3 per cent in 2014. This growth was mirrored by a 19.2 per cent rise in the total domestic credit to KSh 2,830.5 billion in December 2015 compared to a growth of 16.1 per cent in December 2014. 2.3. Key macroeconomic indicators remained relatively stable and supportive of the growth during the year under review. Overall inflation eased from 6.9 per cent in 2014 to 6.6 per cent in 2015 mainly due to lower prices of energy and transport. Monthly inflation rates fluctuated between 5.5 per cent and 8.0 per cent but were largely contained within the Central Bank’s target throughout the year. Generally, the Shilling depreciated against its major trading currencies as reflected by the weighted trade index which worsened by 5.7 per cent during the review period. The Shilling was mainly supported by a significant fall in the international oil prices as the country cut-back expenditure on importation of petroleum fuels and increased diaspora remittances. However, lower earnings from the tourism sector impacted negatively on the exchange rate of the Shilling in 2015. 2.4. In response to rising inflation at the beginning of the year and instability of the shilling, the monetary authorities adjusted the Central Bank Rate (CBR) from 8.50 per cent to 10.0 per cent in June and later to 11.5 per cent in July 2015. The weighted average interest rates on commercial banks loans and advances rose by 1.40 percentage points to 17.45 per cent in December 2015 compared to 15.99 per cent in December 2014.

The growth in export earnings was largely driven by improved prices for some commodities which more than offset the effects of the fall in quantities of export. However, the country’s export growth was curtailed by suppressed external demand. 2.6. The effects of the fall in fuel prices were experienced across most of the industries, with the main beneficiary being transport and storage where there was a significant decline in costs of production. Other sectors that significantly gained from the lower fuel prices include construction and thermal generation of electricity. Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing Sectoral 2.7. The sector’s performance was largely influenced by weather patterns in 2015 with heavy Analysis and well spread long rains experienced in most parts of the country. The short rains period was characterized by the El Niño weather phenomenon that started in November 2015. In the end, output of livestock and most crops was boosted by the weather but a few crops were negatively affected, resulting to a decline in their production. Consequently, the sector recorded an accelerated growth of 5.6 per cent in 2015 compared to 3.5 per cent in 2014. The agriculture sub-sector grew by 6.2 per cent in 2015 and considerably influenced the performance of the whole sector. 2.8. Production of maize increased from 39.0 million bags to 42.5 million bags in 2015 due to favourable weather and reduced incidences of the Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease (MLND). Beans and sorghum also recorded substantial growths of 24.2 per cent and 10.5 per cent, respectively. However, production of potatoes declined by 14.8 per in 2015 due to severe effects of frost during the season. Similarly, production of tea and coffee contracted by 10.3 per cent and 16.0 per cent, respectively in 2015. The value of horticultural exports rose by 7.5 per cent in 2015 on account of increased exports of cut flower and fruit. On the other hand, export of vegetables declined marginally in 2015. 2.9. In the livestock sub-sector, the volume of marketed milk increased by 10.9 per cent from 541.3 million litres in 2014 to 600.4 million litres in 2015. The number of cattle and calves sold to abattoirs rose by 9.5 per in 2015 to stand at 2,274.5 thousand head. Similarly, sheep and goats slaughtered in 2015 increased from 6,138.5 thousand head in 2014 to 6,560.8 thousand head in 2015. Manufacturing 2.10. The macroeconomic environment in 2015 was favourable for the performance of the manufacturing sector except for the cost of borrowing that somewhat curtailed the availability of cheap credit to fund the sector’s activities. In addition, key sectors that heavily influence the performance of the sector namely agriculture and electricity posted impressive performance in the year under review. There was a significant decline in fuel prices, especially light diesel that is used in an array of manufacturing processes, which consequently resulted in a drop in the cost of production. The robust growth in agriculture also influenced the sector’s performance especially in food processing. Against this backdrop, the manufacturing sector expanded by 3.5 per cent in 2015 compared to 3.2 per cent in 2014. 2.11. Manufacturing of food products in all categories increased in 2015 except processing and preservation of fish that registered a decline of 21.8 per cent.

      "Economic Survey 2016 due to the fall in the international oil prices. The growth in export earnings was largely driven by improved prices for some commodities which more than offset the effects of the fall in quantities of export. However, the country’s export growth was curtailed by suppressed external demand. 2.6. The effects of the fall in fuel prices were experienced across most of the industries, with the main beneficiary being transport and storage where there was a significant decline in costs of production. Other sectors that significantly gained from the lower fuel prices include construction and thermal generation of electricity. Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing Sectoral 2.7. The sector’s performance was largely influenced by weather patterns in 2015 with heavy Analysis and well spread long rains experienced in most parts of the country. The short rains period was characterized by the El Niño weather phenomenon that started in November 2015. In the end, output of livestock and most crops was boosted by the weather but a few crops were negatively affected, resulting to a decline in their production. Consequently, the sector recorded an accelerated growth of 5.6 per cent in 2015 compared to 3.5 per cent in 2014.

Production of cement increased from 5,882.5 thousand tonnes in 2014 to 6,352.9 thousand tonnes in 2015. Transport and Storage 2.12. The sector’s growth accelerated to 7.1 per cent in 2015 from the previous growth of 4.6 per cent in 2014. The improved performance was against a background of reduced intermediate consumption as domestic retail prices for petroleum products fell in line with fall in the international oil prices. Globally, Murban crude oil prices almost halved to average at US$ 52.5 per barrel in 2015 compared to US$ 99.5 2014. Domestically, the retail prices for light diesel declined by 9.0 per cent during the review period. The decrease in the international oil prices was driven by increased global production and slowdown in demand from US and China. 2.13. Land transport which comprises road, rail and pipeline expanded by 5.2 per cent in 2015 compared to 4.0 per cent in 2014. Air transport contracted for the second year in a row against suppressed international visitor arrivals, suspension of the national carrier’s operations in some routes in Western Africa and increased competition. All other transport and related activities jointly grew by 16.4 per cent in 2015 compared to a growth of 8.4 per cent in 2014. This growth was mainly on account of rapid expansion in warehousing and storage and cargo handling activities. Information and Communication 2.14. The sector’s growth slowed to 7.3 per cent in 2015 after a robust expansion of 14.6 per cent in 2014. The slowdown was mainly occasioned by a dampened growth in the telecommunications subsector in 2015. Publishing, broadcasting, other Information Technologies and information activities recovered from a 1.8 per cent decline in 2014 to record a growth of 2.9 per cent in 2015. However, the growth remained robust on account of resilient expansion in mobile telephony networks and increased uptake of internet services. The freeing up of valuable portions of the TV broadcast spectrum that emanated from the successful completion of the digital migration facilitated significant growth of digital TV stations thereby boosting the sector’s growth. Financial Intermediation 2.15. Overall, the sector sustained its vibrant performance in 2015 mainly owing to a 9.4 per cent growth in the financial services sub-sector despite the placing of two banks under statutory management. The growth was somehow dampened by the continued decline in the level of activity in the insurance sub-sector whose growth slowed down to 4.9 per cent in 2015. The sector’s performance is clearly manifested in the performance of other sectors especially construction, manufacturing and agriculture that recorded significant rise in credit advanced by commercial banks and cooperative societies. The period under review was also characterized by a significant growth in domestic credit to the National Government from KSh 424.9 billion in 2014 to KSh 538.0 billion in 2015. 2.16. In 2015, the monetary policy principally aimed at achieving and maintaining stability in the general price levels in the economy with the ultimate goal of achieving an inflation target of 5.0 per cent. The year under review was characterized by inflationary pressures and volatility in exchange rate. As a result, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised the Central Bank Rate (CBR) from 8.5 per cent to 10.0 per cent in June, and further to 11.5 per cent in July.

During the same period, the Central Bank of Kenya negotiated a precautionary support programme to cushion the economy from inherent external shocks especially emanating from unforeseen financial instability in the world economy. Electricity Supply 2.18. The sector recorded an accelerated growth of 9.7 per cent in 2015 compared to a growth of 7.3 per cent in 2014. The improved growth was attributed to increased production of geothermal electricity coupled with lower fuel costs for thermal power generation. In addition, there was a significant increase in generation of wind electric power that also boosted the sector’s contribution to GDP. Commissioning of new geothermal plant in late 2014 led to a 55.0 per cent rise in generation of geo-thermal electric power during the review period. Generation of hydroelectric power increased by 1.3 per cent over the same period. In total, 9,455.8GWh was produced in 2015 compared to 8,980.3 GWh in 2014. Effective installed capacity of hydro, thermal oil, and geothermal increased by 0.3, 11.9 and 10.9 per cent, respectively. Effective capacity of wind power almost quadrupled in 2015. Construction 2.19. The construction sector maintained the momentum realized in 2014 to post a growth rate of 13.6 per cent in 2015. This growth was to a great extent buoyed by the development of transport infrastructure such as the continued implementation of the first phase of the Standard Gauge Railway, development of the road network, expansion and rehabilitation of facilities at the airports and improvement of port facilities to enhance operational efficiency. The sector also benefited from the implementation of mega energy projects in line with the flagship projects of the Vision 2030. These include Olkaria 1V (unit 1 &2) and Olkaria 1(unit 4 &5) and wellhead Geothermal projects. Further, the sustained growth in demand for both residential and non-residential structures to house the fast growing urban populations and provision of sufficient office space has positively impacted on the performance of the sector in 2015.Consequently, the real estate sector remained on the growth trajectory that started in 2012 to record a 8.9 per cent in 2015. 2.20. Evidently, the financial services sub-sector also gained from the impressive performance exhibited by the construction sector in the period under review. Loans and advances to building and construction activities registered a substantial increase from KSh 80.4 billion in 2014 to KSh 106.3 billion in 2015. Accommodation and Food Services (Hotels and Restaurants) 2.21. Performance in the accommodation and food services sector has been greatly constrained in the last three years. During this period, the sector showed some signs of recovery by slowing the rate of contraction to 1.3 per cent compared to a revised contraction of 16.7 per cent in 2014. This rejuvenation may partly be as a consequence of the visits by eminent world personalities as well as the hosting of the World Trade Organization (WTO) talks in Nairobi.

The total number of public secondary school and tertiary teachers increased by 8.5 per cent from 78,727 in 2014 to 85,438 in 2015. The increase can be attributed to the recruitment of teachers, as well as reinstatement of teachers who had been out of service due to study leave and disciplinary cases. The total number of male trained teachers increased by 7.6 per cent to 51,350, while that of female teachers grew by 9.2 per cent to 33,881 in 2015.

Secondary School T eachers: The number of secondary school and tertiary college teachers by sex and qualification from 2011 to 2015 is shown in Table 3.10. The total number of public secondary school and tertiary teachers increased by 8.5 per cent from 78,727 in 2014 to 85,438 in 2015. The increase can be attributed to the recruitment of teachers, as well as reinstatement of teachers who had been out of service due to study leave and disciplinary cases. The total number of male trained teachers increased by 7.6 per cent to 51,350, while that of female teachers grew by 9.2 per cent to 33,881 in 2015. During the period under review, the number of male and female trained graduate and S1/Diploma teachers increased significantly. In public secondary schools, the pupil teacher ratio was 27:1 in the same period."

First year diploma trainees enrolment declined by 30.1 per cent from 1,187 in 2014 to 830 in 2015 mainly as a result of the double intake in 2014 while enrolment of first year public primary P1 trainees increased by 14.3 per cent.

Technical and Vocational Educational Training Institutions (TVET): Table 3.12 shows enrolment in TVET institutions from 2011 to 2015. The total enrolment in TVET institutions rose by 4.7 per cent from 148,142 in 2014 to 155,176 in 2015. The increase is partly attributed to expansion of TVET institutions. Student enrolment in national polytechnics and technical universities declined by 5.0 per cent from 23,583 in 2014 to 22,403 in 2015. However, the enrolment of females in these institutions increased by 17.4 per cent compared to a decrease of 18.6 per cent for males. During the review period, enrolment in Technical and Vocational Colleges, formerly Institutes of Technology and Technical Training Institutes, increased from 50,864 in 2014 to 55,308 in 2015. The enrolment in youth polytechnics grew by 5.1 per cent from 73,695 in 2014 to 77,465 in 2015, mainly due to the expansion of the youth ppolytechnics and infrastructure development by the County Governments. 52"

Over the same period, the informal sector registered a growth of 32.9 per cent compared to a 9.1 per cent growth in the formal sector. The increase in the number of registered members in the informal sector may partly be explained by sustained campaigns by the Fund. 60",

National Hospital Insurance Fund Membership: The number of registered members of the National Hospital Insurance Fund from 2010/11 to 2014/15 is shown in Table 3.19 (b). Overall, membership rose by 17.1 per cent from 4,450.4 thousand in 2013/14 to 5,213.2 thousand in 2014/15. The formal sector contributed the bulk of the membership with a share of 61.8 per cent. Over the same period, the informal sector registered a growth of 32.9 per cent compared to a 9.1 per cent growth in the formal sector. The increase in the number of registered members in the informal sector may partly be explained by sustained campaigns by the Fund. 60"

Private sector: The share of private sector employment in modern sector wage employment was 71.0 per cent in 2015, slightly higher than 70.4 per cent recorded in 2014. This was attributed to the slow growth in employment in the public sector relative to the private sector. During the period under review, the private sector recorded a growth of 5.4 per cent in employment levels compared to 4.4 per cent registered in 2014. Overall, the private sector created 90.2 thousand new wage employment compared to 69.6 thousand in 2014. 4.6. In 2015, the largest contributors to wage employment in the private sector were agriculture, forestry and fishing; manufacturing; wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motor cycles; and education accounting for 16.7, 15.3, 13.1 and 10.7 per cent of the total private sector employment, respectively.

The nominal wage bill rose from KSh 1,311.1 billion in 2014 to KSh 1,497.3 billion in 2015, an increase of 14.2 per cent.

The annual inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) decelerated Price Index marginally from 6.9 per cent in 2014 to 6.6 per cent in 2015. The easing of inflation was largely due to reduced costs of petroleum products, electricity and tight monetary policies. The first quarter of 2015 was characterized by drought conditions that pushed up prices of some food items such as potatoes, tomatoes, milk, cabbages, beans and onions. However, during the second half of the year, weather conditions improved resulting in increased supplies and corresponding decreases in prices of several food items. 4.26. Table 4.15(a) shows percentage changes of the indices in the broad divisions of all consumer goods and services from 2011 to 2015. Food and Non-alcoholic beverages’s index which has largest weight in the CPI basket increased by 11.4 per cent to 188.22 in 2015. The Transport index decreased by 0.5 per cent to 160.61 points in 2015 compared with 2014 mainly due to lower costs of petrol and diesel. Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels index went up by 3.2 per cent during the review period mainly due to increases in house rents.

The monetary policy aimed to achieve the inflation target of 5.0 per cent as set out in the budget for the fiscal year 2014/15. The MPC raised the Central Bank Rate (CBR) from 8.5 per cent to 10.0 per cent in June, and further to 11.5 per cent in July, 2015 to contain incipient inflationary pressures and stem exchange rate volatility. As a result, the overall annual inflation eased slightly to 6.58 per cent in 2015 from 6.88 per cent in 2014. The Government negotiated a precautionary programme support with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to mitigate the impact of possible exogenous shocks in 2015. Through the programme, the IMF made available the cumulative amount of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 434.24 million (USD 610.7 million) that provided adequate buffer against short-term shocks and strengthened Kenya’s external position. In view of this, the Central Bank set out the optimal path for both reserve money and money supply expansion consistent with the Government’s inflation target and the expected economic growth. Money supply, M3, was targeted to grow by 14.2 per cent in the review period. 5.2. The Central Bank of Kenya used Open Market Operations (OMO), repo securities and Term Auction Deposits (TAD), to sterilize excess liquidity in the money market and to reduce volatility of the interbank rate during the year. The Monetary Policy Committee adjusted the pricing of the TAD instrument by 250 basis points above the CBR in May 2015 to enhance liquidity management. The excess liquidity was occasioned by net redemptions of government securities as well as government payments. During this period, CBK sold and purchased foreign exchange from the interbank market to stabilize liquidity and mitigate exchange rate volatility. The short-term money market interest rates trended close to the CBR corridor. The interbank rate increased from an average of 6.60 per cent in June 2014 to 11.8 per cent in June 2015. 5.3. Interest rates recorded mixed performance with spikes and dips for most nominal rates in 2015. The CBR increased from 8.50 per cent in December 2014 to 10.00 per cent and 11.50 per cent in June and December 2015, respectively. Lending interest rates for loans and advances from commercial banks rose from 15.99 per cent in December 2014 to 17.45 per cent in December 2015. Similarly, the Commercial banks’ Loans-Deposit interest rate spread rose from 9.18 percentage points in December 2014 to 9.53 percentage points in December 2015. 5.4. Performance of the capital market in 2015 was depressed. The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) 20-Share index recorded a high of 5,346 points during the first quarter of the year but dipped to 4,040 points in December 2015, representing a drop of 21.0 per cent compared to December 2014. The total number of shares traded during the review period also went down to 6,812 million from 8,134 million reported in 2014.

The arrangements boosted the Bank’s capacity to respond to short-term volatility in the foreign exchange market. 5.21. To strengthen the banking sector’s capital position, the Central Bank introduced a 2.5 per cent capital conservation buffer in 2013 and which became effective on 1st January 2015. The capital buffer is to be maintained by institutions as a cushion for losses during periods of financial and economic stress. As a consequence of this introduction, the effective minimum core and total capital requirements rose from 8.0 per cent and 12.0 per cent to 10.5 per cent and 14.5 per cent, respectively. As at December 2015 these ratios had risen above the statutory requirements at 15.6 per cent and 18.6 per cent respectively. The money market experienced a small turbulence from August to October 2015 following pressures on the Government borrowing programme and the placement of two commercial banks under receivership in the months of August and October respectively. However, given the two institutions small market share, the receivership/liquidation did not cause any systemic concern for the banking sector. The CBK used Reverse Repos to address the temporary liquidity shortages in segments of the market arising from these stresses. 5.22. In the primary equity market, the first Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) - namely, Capital Stanlib Fahari REIT got listed through an Initial Public Offer (IPO) process in the newly Market created Real Estate Investment Segment of the NSE in October 2015. The Stanlib REIT raised KSh 3.6 billion against a minimum target of KSh 2.6 billion. Further, during the year there was one (1) new rights issue by Housing Finance. In this cash call, Housing Finance sought to raise KSh 3.5 billion by issuing 116,666,667 new ordinary shares at an Offer Price of KSh 30.00 (28.9 per cent discount) per share in the ratio of 1:2. The issue received a 257 per cent subscription level, raising KSh 9.01 billion. 5.23. In the primary Treasury Bonds space, during the period under review, there were sixteen (16) bond issue offers including re-openings. The bonds’ tenure ranged between 2 and 20 years. In 2015, the Government of Kenya sought to raise KSh 270 billion and received subscriptions worth KSh 346.5 billion. However, it accepted to issue bonds worth KSh 256.7 billion. Subscription levels for the various tenures of bonds were between 46.5 per cent and 204.5 per cent. The Corporate Bonds space was also relatively active in 2015, with Five (5) companies (East African Breweries, Centum Investment Company Limited, Chase Bank, Real People and Family Bank) raising a total of KSh 19.5 billion. 5.24. The Authority approved Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) to operate a derivatives exchange business in Kenya in December 2015. The approval was the final step towards confirmation of a provisional license that the NSE had been granted in January 2015. The approval confirms NSE’s full compliance with The Capital Markets (Futures Exchanges) (Licensing Requirements) Regulations, 2013 which were drafted in line with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for the Regulation and Supervision of Commodity Derivatives Markets. 5.25.

Details of key fiscal ratios for the period 2011/12 to 2015/16 are given in Table 6.2. In 2015/16, the ratio of Net Operating Balance to expenditure on acquisition of non-financial assets is estimated to improve notably from 73.4 per cent in 2014/15 to 39.0 per cent in 2015/16. This demonstrates the deliberate effort by the government to reorient spending from recurrent to capital expenditure. Net borrowing as a percentage of revenue is estimated to register an improvement of 15.7 percentage points in 2015/16 mainly attributable to a faster growth in anticipated revenue. Similarly, the ratio of net borrowing to total expenditure is estimated to improve from 28.1 per cent in 2014/15 to 21.5 per cent in 2015/16. In the same period, the ratio of total external loans and grants to acquisition of non-financial assets is estimated to increase by 30 percentage points principally as a result of a significant growth in borrowing to finance development of key physical infrastructure. The ratios of revenue and expenditure as a percentage of GDP are expected increase to 23.6 and 35.7 per cent in 2015. Net borrowing is expected to improve from a deficit of 9.3 in 2014 to 7.6 per cent in 2015. The ratio of public debt to GDP stood at 41.8 in 2014/15. 103",

Details of key fiscal ratios for the period 2011/12 to 2015/16 are given in Table 6.2. In 2015/16, the ratio of Net Operating Balance to expenditure on acquisition of non-financial assets is estimated to improve notably from 73.4 per cent in 2014/15 to 39.0 per cent in 2015/16. This demonstrates the deliberate effort by the government to reorient spending from recurrent to capital expenditure. Net borrowing as a percentage of revenue is estimated to register an improvement of 15.7 percentage points in 2015/16 mainly attributable to a faster growth in anticipated revenue. Similarly, the ratio of net borrowing to total expenditure is estimated to improve from 28.1 per cent in 2014/15 to 21.5 per cent in 2015/16. In the same period, the ratio of total external loans and grants to acquisition of non-financial assets is estimated to increase by 30 percentage points principally as a result of a significant growth in borrowing to finance development of key physical infrastructure. The ratios of revenue and expenditure as a percentage of GDP are expected increase to 23.6 and 35.7 per cent in 2015. Net borrowing is expected to improve from a deficit of 9.3 in 2014 to 7.6 per cent in 2015. The ratio of public debt to GDP stood at 41.8 in 2014/15. 103"

In 2015/16, the total ordinary revenue is projected to grow by 26.6 per cent compared to a growth of 13.5 per cent in 2014/15. Total tax revenue is expected to amount to KSh 1,288.9 billion, accounting for 92.0 per cent of total ordinary revenue during the period under review. Revenue from Income tax and Value Added Tax (VAT) areexpectedto increase by 22.5 per cent and 25.1 per cent, respectively. Revenue from excise taxes is expected to grow by 24.7 per cent to stand at KSh 144.5 billion. This growth will be supported by the enactment of the Excise Tax Act 2015 which has led to the expansion of the tax bracket to include products that were previously not covered such as airtime and financial transactions. The Government has also instituted other administrative reforms to enhance compliance with the tax system and ensure stable tax revenue collections. Further, the reform measures are expected to enhance revenue collection through increased tax base, reduced compliance costs and efficient revenue administration.

Import duty collection realised in 2015 was KSh 71.2 billion; representing a slower growth of 8.8per cent, compared to a growth of 18.4 per cent in 2014.

    "text": "Chapter 6: Public Finance 6.15. Table 6.11 details the National Government outstanding debt by source for the period 2011 to 2015. The total stock ofdebt grew by 17.3 per cent to KSh 2,601.4 billion in June 2015, of which the external debt amounted to KSh 1,423.3 billion. Stock of debt from the International Sovereign Bond constituted 19.1 per cent of the total external debt as at June 2015 compared to 15.4 per cent as at June 2014. Bilateral external debt from all the traditional lenders declined with the exception of debt stock from the People’s Republic of China, which grew significantly by KSh 171.2 billion to KSh 252.0 billion in June 2015. This growth was driven by the continued bilateral engagements in infrastructural development initiatives between the two countries.

Table 7.2(a) shows export and import unit price indices by commodity groups based on changes the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) for the period 2011 to 2015. The unit price indices for all exports and non-oil exports increased by 12.9 per cent and 13.0 per cent, respectively, in 2015. This could mainly be explained by rise in export unit price of food and live animals, chemicals and miscellaneous manufactured articles, which increased by 28.1, 15.7 and 10.9 per cent, respectively, in 2015. However, the mineral fuels export price index contracted by 11.9 per cent following the decline in oil prices during the review period. The unit price index for all imports decreased by 2.8 per cent mainly due to a drop of 58.3 per cent of unit price indices of mineral fuels. Decrease in import unit price indices of animal and vegetable oil and fats; and miscellaneous manufactured articles also contributed to the drop in the overall imports unit price. This compensated for the increase in import prices of machinery and transport equipment; and manufactured goods whose unit price indices rose by 21.1 per cent and 19.0per cent, respectively, in 2015. The unit price index for non-oil imports increased by 20.2 per cent during the review period. 120",

Non-food industrial supplies were the leading class of imports with expenditure growing of Imports by 13.5 per cent to KSh 525 billion in 2015, as shown in Table 7.7. This represents 33.3 per cent of total imports during the year. Importation of machinery and other capital equipment rose for the second consecutive year from KSh 279 billion in 2014 to KSh 288 billion in 2015. Transport equipment accounted for 16.9 per cent of the total imports despite declining from KSh 279 billion in 2014 to KSh 267 billion in 2015. The drop was mainly driven by a 13.1 per cent reduction in expenditure on other industrial transport equipment, which amounted to KSh 158 billion.

Non-food industrial supplies were the leading class of imports with expenditure growing of Imports by 13.5 per cent to KSh 525 billion in 2015, as shown in Table 7.7. This represents 33.3 per cent of total imports during the year. Importation of machinery and other capital equipment rose for the second consecutive year from KSh 279 billion in 2014 to KSh 288 billion in 2015. Transport equipment accounted for 16.9 per cent of the total imports despite declining from KSh 279 billion in 2014 to KSh 267 billion in 2015. The drop was mainly driven by a 13.1 per cent reduction in expenditure on other industrial transport equipment, which amounted to KSh 158 billion. The least expenditure was on goods not elsewhere specified that dropped significantly from KSh 27 billion in 2014 to KSh 12 billion in 2015. 131"

Asia continued its dominance as the leading source of the country’s imports despite the value contracting from KSh 990 billion recorded in 2014 to KSh 982 billion in 2015 as presented in Table 7.9. Within the region, China was the leading source of imports that expanded significantly from KSh 249 billion in 2014 to KSh 321 billion in 2015. This was explained by substantial increases in import expenditure for railway construction materials from China. Despite recording a 4.5 per cent drop in the value of imports, India remained the second largest source of imports in 2015. The United Arab Emirates, Japan and Saudi Arabia had imports valued at KSh 91 billion, KSh 88 billion and KSh 55 billion, respectively, in 2015. The value of imports from the United Arab Emirates dropped by 12.3 per cent over the same period. 7.17. Imports from the EU had a value of KSh 233 billion, accounting for 14.8 per cent of the total import bill in 2015. Germany continued to be the leading source of imports from the EU for the second consecutive year with imports valued at KSh 47 billion in 2015. Import expenditure from the United Kingdom and France dropped by 8.7 and 6.2 per cent to KSh 43 billion and KSh 21 billion, respectively, in 2015. However, import expenditure from Italy, Netherlands and Russian Federation rose during the review period. Imports from Africa rose from KSh 146 billion in 2014 to KSh 149 billion in 2015. Imports from America registered a significant drop from KSh 187 billion in 2014 to KSh 146 billion in 2015. The drop in the expenditure on imports from America was mainly attributed to 25.3 per cent decline in imports from the USA. The decline in import from the USA was mainly as a result of 35.1 per cent drop in value of aeroplanes and other aircraft amounting to KSh 75 billion in 2015. 133",

Asia continued its dominance as the leading source of the country’s imports despite the value contracting from KSh 990 billion recorded in 2014 to KSh 982 billion in 2015 as presented in Table 7.9. Within the region, China was the leading source of imports that expanded significantly from KSh 249 billion in 2014 to KSh 321 billion in 2015. This was explained by substantial increases in import expenditure for railway construction materials from China. Despite recording a 4.5 per cent drop in the value of imports, India remained the second largest source of imports in 2015. The United Arab Emirates, Japan and Saudi Arabia had imports valued at KSh 91 billion, KSh 88 billion and KSh 55 billion, respectively, in 2015. The value of imports from the United Arab Emirates dropped by 12.3 per cent over the same period. 7.17. Imports from the EU had a value of KSh 233 billion, accounting for 14.8 per cent of the total import bill in 2015. Germany continued to be the leading source of imports from the EU for the second consecutive year with imports valued at KSh 47 billion in 2015. Import expenditure from the United Kingdom and France dropped by 8.7 and 6.2 per cent to KSh 43 billion and KSh 21 billion, respectively, in 2015. However, import expenditure from Italy, Netherlands and Russian Federation rose during the review period. Imports from Africa rose from KSh 146 billion in 2014 to KSh 149 billion in 2015. Imports from America registered a significant drop from KSh 187 billion in 2014 to KSh 146 billion in 2015. The drop in the expenditure on imports from America was mainly attributed to 25.3 per cent decline in imports from the USA. The decline in import from the USA was mainly as a result of 35.1 per cent drop in value of aeroplanes and other aircraft amounting to KSh 75 billion in 2015. 133"

Kenya’s Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics are compiled according to Balance of Payments Payments and International Investment Position Manual, 6th edition (BPM6). BOP statistics for the period 2011 to 2014 have been revised. The revision was necessitated by the new data sources including data collected through informal cross border trade and foreign investment surveys. Three rounds foreign investment surveys have conducted namely; Foreign Investment Survey (FIS) 2010, FIS 2013 and FIS 2015 which captured international financial transaction flows. 7.22. As presented in Table 7.11, the balance of payments position deteriorated from a surplus of KSh 128 billion in 2014 to a deficit of KSh 25 billion in 2015, largely attributed to repayments of external loans. The current account balance improved by 19.5 per cent from a deficit of KSh 528 billion in 2014 to a deficit of KSh425 billion in 2015. This was as a result of 7.4 per cent increase in merchandise exports and a marginal decline in merchandise imports on free on board basis. This decline in merchandise imports was on account of decrease in expenditure on petroleum products owing to the decline in international oil prices. Increased export earnings from tea boosted the value of domestic exports during the review period. Consequently, the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP improved to 6.8 in 2015 from 9.8 in 2014. 7.23. International services receipts decreased by 0.9 per cent to KSh 422 billion in 2015. Over the same period, services payments declined by 9.1 per cent to KSh 213 billion. These developments translated into a surplus of KSh 229 billion in international services flows in 2015 from a surplus of KSh 211billion in 2014. 7.24. The financial account net inflows decreased by 19.2 per cent from a surplus of KSh 616 billion in 2014 to a surplus of KSh 498 billion in 2015. The decrease in the financial account surplus was partly occasioned by increased external repayments of loans and bearish activities at the Nairobi Securities Exchange that may have discouraged foreign inflows in the market. Direct investment net inflows increased from a surplus of KSh 92 billion in 2014 to a surplus of KSh 107 billion in 2015. 138",

The value of marketed production for the period 2011 to 2015 is presented in Table 8.2. Production Total value of marketed production at current prices increased by 11.3 per cent from KSh 333.2 billion in 2014 to KSh 371.0 billion in 2015. Overall, the value of marketed crops increased by 15.5 per cent from KSh 235.3 billion in 2014 to KSh 271.8 billion in 2015. Marketed crops continued to account for over 70 per cent of total marketed production in 2015, largely due to improved earnings from tea and horticulture exports. 8.5. The value of marketed maize declined by 11.4 per cent from KSh 9.6 billion in 2014 to KSh 8.5 billion in 2015, mainly on account of lower prices paid to farmers. The lower prices were mainly triggered by increased production which improved largely as a result of adequate rainfall and a lower incidence of the Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease. During the review period, there was a 7.6 per cent increase in the value of marketed wheat from KSh 7.6 billion in 2014 to KSh 8.2 billion. The value of marketed fresh horticultural produce increased from KSh 84.1 billion in 2014 to KSh 90.4 billion in 2015. This was attributed to better unit prices for vegetables and higher volumes of fruits exported. The value of vegetables exported increased by 11.2 per cent from KSh 18.8 billion in 2014 to KSh 20.9 billion in 2015. Improved international tea prices more than offset the effects of reduced marketed production, resulting in a 39.5 per cent increase in earnings to KSh 118.4 billion in 2015. During the year under review, international coffee prices deteriorated significantly. The decline in marketed production coupled with a reduction in international coffee prices, resulted in a 27.4 per cent decrease in domestic coffee earnings to KSh 12.1 billion in 2015. In contrast, value of marketed milk increased by 10.1 145",

The overall price index for agricultural inputs decreased from 191.3 in 2014 to 186.6 in 2015 as a result of lower prices paid for fuel and power. The overall quantum index decreased from 221.6 in 2014 to 186.5 in 2015, while that for fertilizer and purchased seeds increased from 240.1 and 206.3 in 2014 to 245.0 and 210.5, respectively, in 2015. The increase in the quantum index for fertilizer was partly due to the continued provision of subsidized fertilizers to farmers by the Government. The quantum index for fuel and power increased from 101.1 in 2014 to 101.6 in 2015, while that for manufactured feeds reduced marginally from 434.3 in 2014 to 430.8 in 2015. 148",

Table 8.8 shows the agriculture Terms of Trade for the period 2011 to 2015. The index of purchased inputs decreased from 191.3 in 2014 to 186.6 in 2015, mainly due to a reduction in the price of fuel and power. The general index of agricultural output prices rose from 150.9 in 2014 to 162.6 in 2015, due to improved prices for some of the agricultural commodities. Similarly, the index of purchased consumer goods in rural areas rose from 420.7 in 2014 to 449.7 in 2015. The resultant effect of improved output prices outweighed the increased farm input prices. Consequently, the overall agriculture terms of trade improved from 49.3 in 2014 to 51.1 in 2015.

During the year under review, wheat production increased by 4.2 per cent from 228.9 thousand tonnes in 2014 to 238.6 thousand tonnes. This production was mainly due to favourable weather conditions in the wheat growing areas. High demand for wheat products has seen the quantity of wheat imports rise over the last two years with imports increasing from 1,225.7 thousand tonnes in 2014 to 1,421.8 thousand tonnes in 2015.

Production by estates has exhibited downward trend since 2011/12 as compared to that of cooperatives, which recorded a mixed performance. The decrease in production during the review period was mainly as a result of high cost of labour, escalating cost of farm inputs and poor cooperate governance at grower institutions.

The area planted with tea increased by 3.2 per cent from 203.0 thousand hectares in 2014 to 209.4 thousand hectares in 2015, primarily from smallholders. Despite the increase in area under tea, production decreased significantly by 10.3 per cent from 445.1 thousand tonnes in 2014 to 399.1 thousand tonnes in 2015. Consequently, the average yield decreased by 9.4 per cent for the smallholders, and by 13.2 per cent for the estates.

During the period under review, the area under cane increased by 5.8 per cent from 211,342 hectares in 2014 to 223,624 hectares in 2015. This increase was partly due to the introduction of Kwale International Sugar Company which started its operations early 2015. As a result, area harvested increased significantly by 8.3 per cent from 72,181 hectares recorded in 2014 to 78,140 hectares in 2015.

Te a : Table 8.14 presents the annual performance of tea sub-sector from 2011 to 2015. The area planted with tea increased by 3.2 per cent from 203.0 thousand hectares in 2014 to 209.4 thousand hectares in 2015, primarily from smallholders. Despite the increase in area under tea, production decreased significantly by 10.3 per cent from 445.1 thousand tonnes in 2014 to 399.1 thousand tonnes in 2015. Consequently, the average yield decreased by 9.4 per cent for the smallholders, and by 13.2 per cent for the estates.

Sugarcane : Table 8.15 shows the performance of sugarcane sub-sector from 2011 to 2015. During the period under review, the area under cane increased by 5.8 per cent from 211,342 hectares in 2014 to 223,624 hectares in 2015. This increase was partly due to the introduction of Kwale International Sugar Company which started its operations early 2015. As a result, area harvested increased significantly by 8.3 per cent from 72,181 hectares recorded in 2014 to 78,140 hectares in 2015. Overall, cane deliveries increased by 4.6 per cent to 6.8 million tonnes in 2015."

The volume of vegetable exports declined for the second year running partly due to delays in signing the Economic Partnership Agreement and stringent checks for pesticide levels.

Total paddy production rose by 24.0 per cent from 96,029 tonnes in 2014 to 119,094 tonnes in 2015 despite area cropped and number of farmers remaining constant. Paddy production by the Mwea irrigation scheme increased by 30.1 per cent to 91,624 tonnes in 2015, to account for 76.9 per cent of total production. However, all other schemes jointly recorded a 7.0 per cent increase. During the period under review, gross value of rice output increased from KSh 4.5 billion in 2014 to KSh 6.7 billion in 2015. Payment to plot-holders almost doubled from KSh 3.3 billion in 2014 to KSh 6.3 billion in 2015.

The FBS shows the sources of supply and respective utilization for each food item. The food supply is presented in terms of Per Caput Daily Supply of calories, proteins and fats. These are obtained by subjecting the total food supply to relevant food conversion factors and averaging for the total population during the reference period. Further, the country’s dependence on own production is monitored by the Self Sufficiency Ratio (SSR). The Import Dependency Ratio (IDR) monitors the country’s dependence on imported food commodities. FBS 8.28. Table 8.23 shows the Food Balance Sheet (FBS) indicators trend for the period 2011 Indicators to 2015. The Per Caput Daily Supply of Calories improved modestly from 2,202 kilo calories in 2014 to 2,293 kilo calories in 2015. During the review period, per caput supply of proteins and fats improved to 69 grammes and 47grammes, respectively. The improvement in the FBS indicators is consistent with increase in agricultural production during the year 2015. As shown in the FBS, vegetable products (which include all food commodities other than animal products) have over the years remained the preferred foods, contributing 1,979 kilo calories in 2015 compared to 313 kilo calories for animal products. 8.29. The SSR improved slightly from 74.4 per cent in 2014 to 75.2 per cent in 2015. The SSR for vegetable increased by 0.6 per cent to 72.1 per cent in 2015 compared to 2014. The country’s level of self sufficiency on animal products improved from 99.9 per cent in 2014 to 100.0 per cent in 2015. The level of dependency on imported foods slowed from 29.2 per cent in 2014 to 28.3 per cent in 2015. Over the years, most imported food supplies are vegetable products. In 2015, IDR for vegetables declined slightly to 31.7 per cent. This indicates that during the review period, the country depended slightly less on imports of vegetables compared to 2014.

Fish production from fresh water sources remained the major source of fish landed, accounting for over 90 per cent of the total output in the year under review. The high cost of acquiring deep water facilities coupled with inadequate deep water fishing technology remains a limiting factor in the growth of fish production from marine sources. 9.10.

Fish landed from fresh water sources dropped by 15.0 per cent from 159.3 thousand metric tonnes in 2014 to 135.4 thousand metric tonnes in 2015, mainly attributed to decline in fish catches from Lake Victoria and fish farming. The decline in landings from Lake Victoria is partly explained by dwindling stocks of the Nile Perch species in the lake. Fish output from fish farming reduced by 22.4 per cent from 24.1 thousand metric tonnes in 2014 to 18.7 thousand metric tonnes in 2015.

Total sales of timber decreased by 47.1 per cent from 1,197.6 thousand true cubic metres in 2014 to 633.5 thousand true cubic metres in 2015. The decline is mainly explained by the huge reduction in harvesting of softwood timber from 1,167.0 thousand true cubic metres in 2014 to 621.1 thousand true cubic metres in 2015. Sale of hardwood timber more than halved from 30.6 thousand true cubic metres in 2014 to 12.4 thousand true cubic metres in 2015. The reported quantity of hardwood tree species was as a result of clearing part of the natural forests for electricity way-leaves. Sale of fuel wood/charcoal, normally obtained as waste from the sale of forest products, stood at 43.7 thousand stacked cubic metres in 2015.

Production of gemstones increased significantly from 247.3 tonnes in 2014 to 442.0 tonnes in 2015. This was as a result of increased demand of low grade ruby, sapphire and opals from Sri Lanka, Thailand and India in the year under review. Illmenite and rutile registered growths in production of 58.1 per cent and 50.5 per cent, respectively in 2015. In contrast, production of zircon which is also a titanium ore declined by 35.3 per cent to 26.0 thousand tonnes in 2015. 9.18. The overall value of mineral output rose by 14.7 per cent from KSh 21.1 billion in 2014 to KSh 24.2 billion in 2015.

The increase will mainly be driven by expenditure on refuse removal which is expected to increase by 11.8 percent to KSh 285.0 million in 2015/16. Refuse removal accounted for more than 60 per cent of the total expenditure. Expenditure on cleaning and administration is however, expected to decline from KSh143.0 million in 2014/15 to KSh139.6 million in 2015/16. The budgeted expenditure for cleaning- general in 2015/16 is expected to increase tremendously by 43.5 per cent to KSh 30.0 million in 2015/16 on account of payments incurred during engagement of the youth in monthly street clean up exercises.

Source: Nairobi City County * Provisional Wildlife 9.21. The diverse wildlife species in the country continues to attract both domestic and international visitors. Consequently, the Government has continued to implement measures aimed at combating poaching and illegal trade in wildlife products. 9.22. Wildlife population by species within the Kenyan rangelands, derived through the use of aerial sample surveys is shown in Table 9.10. The population of buffaloes, Burchell’s zebras, elands, Thompson’s gazelles, warthogs and impalas increased in the review period. Conversely, the population of elephants, giraffes, wildebeests, gerenuks, ostriches, oryx and waterbucks declined over the same period. The decline in some of the wildlife herbivores was mainly attributed to cross border movements in search of vegetation and poaching of some of the species like Elephants. Other species that showed miniminal variation in numbers were Grant’s gazelle, Grevy zebra, Hunters’ hartebeest, kongoni, kudu and topi. 173",

The total budgeted expenditure for refuse management by Nairobi City County is Management expected to increase by 8.5 per cent from KSh 419.1 million in 2014/15 to KSh 454.6 million in 2015/16 as shown in Table 9.9. The increase will mainly be driven by expenditure on refuse removal which is expected to increase by 11.8 percent to KSh 285.0 million in 2015/16. Refuse removal accounted for more than 60 per cent of the total expenditure. Expenditure on cleaning and administration is however, expected to decline from KSh143.0 million in 2014/15 to KSh139.6 million in 2015/16. The budgeted expenditure for cleaning- general in 2015/16 is expected to increase tremendously by 43.5 per cent to KSh 30.0 million in 2015/16 on account of payments incurred during engagement of the youth in monthly street clean up exercises.

Source: Nairobi City County * Provisional Wildlife 9.21. The diverse wildlife species in the country continues to attract both domestic and international visitors. Consequently, the Government has continued to implement measures aimed at combating poaching and illegal trade in wildlife products. 9.22. Wildlife population by species within the Kenyan rangelands, derived through the use of aerial sample surveys is shown in Table 9.10. The population of buffaloes, Burchell’s zebras, elands, Thompson’s gazelles, warthogs and impalas increased in the review period. Conversely, the population of elephants, giraffes, wildebeests, gerenuks, ostriches, oryx and waterbucks declined over the same period. The decline in some of the wildlife herbivores was mainly attributed to cross border movements in search of vegetation and poaching of some of the species like Elephants. Other species that showed miniminal variation in numbers were Grant’s gazelle, Grevy zebra, Hunters’ hartebeest, kongoni, kudu and topi. 173"

Sunny and dry weather conditions were, however, dominant over the entire country during the onset month of March 2015. Most of the rainfall was recorded during the second half of April and throughout the month of May 2015.

The assessment of the March-April-May (MAM) ‘long rains’ depicted generally good rainfall over most parts of the country. Most meteorological stations recorded rainfall amounts that were above 50 per cent of their Long-Term Means (LTMs). Kakamega, Moi Air Base, Dagoretti, Embu, Kisumu, Wilson Airport, and Kitale stations received rainfall that was above their LTM. However, Wajir, Mandera, Machakos, Nyahururu, Laikipia, Marsabit, Nyeri, Nakuru and Moyale recorded rainfall that was well below their LTM. 175"

Most parts of the country experienced heavy and continuous rainfall during the October- November-December (OND) 2015 “short-rains” season. The rainfall was especially heavy over the Western and Central regions as well as several parts of North Eastern, South Eastern and the Coastal strip. This resulted in massive flooding, landslides/mudslides and loss of lives and property as well as destruction of the infrastructure. The areas that were significantly affected included counties in the Western, Rift Valley and North Eastern parts of Kenya. 9.28. Most meteorological stations recorded rainfall amounts well above 125 per cent of their seasonal LTMs. Eldoret station, for example, recorded more than double the amount normally recorded at the station during the OND season. Other stations that recorded very high amounts included Eldoret Airport, Narok and Nyahururu. Further analysis indicates that the rainfall amounts recorded in some parts of the country were comparable to those recorded during the El Niño episode of OND in 1997. Indeed, the rainfall at Kitale, Kisii, Kakamega and Nyahururu stations exceeded that of 1997.

The lowest price observed in 2015 was USD 37.25 per barrel recorded in December 2015, while the highest was recorded in May 2015 at USD 65.75 per barrel. This was mainly due to sustained excess supply of crude oil compared to global demand driven by slowed pace of growth in the Chinese economy, increased US production of shale oil and the over-supply by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The over-supply by OPEC was due to a substantial increase in production by Iraq.

In 2015/16, the Government implemented the Last Mile Connectivity Project which aims at increasing electricity access to Kenyans. Through this initiative, REA was to exploit to the maximum the existing distribution transformers through extension of low voltage network to reach households lying within transformers protection distance. 10.18. In 2015, REA financed electricity supply to a total of 21,487 public primary schools, 17,809 on grid and 3,678 on solar. Further, 490 other public facilities were also connected to the grid during the period.

Overall, credit to the manufacturing sector increased from KSh 237,422 million in 2014 to KSh 290,069 million in 2015. The value of manufacturing projects approved by industrial financial institutions also increased to KSh 1,092.0 million in 2015 from KSh 569.1 million in 2014. The sector was negatively affected by cheap imports, high cost of capital and disincentives to export because of delayed Value Added Tax refunds. 11.2. In 2015, enterprises operating under Export Processing Zone (EPZ) program recorded increase in employment, exports, imports, and expenditure on local goods and services.

Producer prices as measured by Producer Price Index (PPI) increased by 3.9 per cent from 109.17 in 2014 to 113.43 in 2015.

Beef production went up from 419.1 thousand tonnes in 2014 to 459.4 thousand tonnes in 2015. Production of sausages and processed chicken went up by 10.7 per cent and 0.1 per cent, respectively. However, production of processed fish dropped significantly by 21.8 per cent. As a result, the quantities of fish and fish preparations exported declined by 29.0 per cent from 15,213 tonnes in 2014 to 10,801 tonnes in 2015. 11.8. Preparation and preservation of fruits and vegetables increased by 2.3 per cent in 2015 after a contraction of 15.9 per cent in 2014. Quantities of prepared and preserved vegetables went up by 12.1 per cent while that of prepared and processed fruits dropped by 2.3 per cent during the year under review. 11.9. Manufacture of animal and vegetable fats and oils increased by 6.5 per cent in 2015. The amount of processed vegetable oils increased by 12.2 per cent and that of vegetable fats grew marginally by 0.8 per cent during the review period. There has been a rising demand for vegetable oils compared to vegetable fats over the years mainly due to health awareness and concerns. 11.10. Production of dairy products registered a growth of 8.2 per cent in 2015. Quantity of processed milk increased by 4.3 per cent from 419.3 million litres in 2014 to 437.5 million litres in 2015. The rise is attributable to favourable weather conditions in 2015, which led to increase in pasture and fodder. Production of yoghurt and other fermented milk went up significantly by 24.5 per cent during the same period. 11.11. Grain mill products recorded an impressive growth of 7.8 per cent in 2015 mainly driven by increased processing of wheat flour which grew by 11.1 per cent from 988.7 thousand tonnes in 2014 to 1,098.6 thousand tonnes in 2015. Maize milling in the formal sector rose marginally by 1.7 per cent while milled rice went up by 3.1 per cent from 60.5 thousand tonnes in 2014 to 62.4 thousand tonnes in 2015. Production of animal feeds grew by 4.5 per cent. Manufacture of bakery products increased by 7.2 per cent in 2015, of which biscuits and bread went up by 9.5 per cent and 7.0 per cent, respectively. 11.12. Production of sugar increased by 6.6 per cent from 592.7 thousand tonnes in 2014 to 632.0 thousand tonnes in 2015 mainly attributable to improved supply of cane. However, the sugar industry is still under global and regional threat due to high cost of production, and is therefore uncompetitive in the region and locally. Other challenges are low yields; obsolete milling technology, which leads to inefficiency; and poor transport infrastructure in accessing the cane from the farms. Manufacture of cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery registered a marginal growth of 0.8 per cent in 2015.

    "text": "Chapter 11: Manufacturing 11.13. There was a decline in quantities of processed tea and coffee, classified under food products not elsewhere classified. Tea processed declined by 10.3 per cent from 445.1 thousand tonnes in 2014 to 399.2 thousand tonnes in 2015. Production of semi-processed coffee dropped by 15.9 per cent from 49.5 thousand tonnes in 2014 to 41.6 thousand tonnes in 2015. However, production of roasted coffee went up by 7.8 per in 2015. During the same period, processed refined salt increased by 8.7 per cent. 11.14. Manufacture of beverages grew by 22.0 per cent in 2015 mainly driven by production of spirits and beer, which went up by 27.9 and 28.9 per cent, respectively. The remarkable growth in beer production is attributed to a 90 per cent remission of excise duty for beer made from domestically grown sorghum, millet or cassava. Volume of carbonated drinks produced increased by 8.5 per cent from 457.5 million litres in 2014 to 496.0 million litres in 2015. During the same period, production of mineral drinking water grew by 11.7 per cent. 11.15. Manufacture of tobacco products went down by 4.4 per cent in 2015. Production of cigarettes declined by 4.7 per cent to 27.2 million milles. However, other manufactured tobacco products increased by 18.7 per cent leading to an increase of 326 .6 thousand tonnes in exports. 11.16. Textile production went up by 8.1 per cent while that of twine, cordage and rope recovered to grow by 25.1 per cent in 2015. Over the same period, manufacture of blankets increased by 11.7 per cent. On the other hand, production of woven fabrics and knitting wool declined by 0.3 per cent and 8.2 per cent, respectively. 11.17. Production of wearing apparel registered an impressive growth of 10.8 per cent in 2015 mainly driven by T-shirt production, which went up by 19.0 per cent. On the other hand, production of knitted fabrics and shirts dropped by 7.8 per cent and 2.3 per cent, respectively. 11.18. Leather and related products recorded a decline of 12.2 per cent in 2015. This was due to a drop of 16.3 per cent in finished leather products. Quantities of exported leather dropped by 11.0 per cent in 2015 to 23,329 tonnes. The drop in exported leather products may be attributed to the imposition of 80 per cent export tariff on raw hides and skin to encourage value addition. However, production of shoes with uppers of leather went up marginally by 0.8 per cent while production of shoes with uppers of plastic and rubber increased by 2.0 per cent. The sluggish growth in the shoes industry is attributed to competition from imports of new low cost leather and non-leather footwear and second hand footwear. 11.19. Manufacture of wood and products of wood, which are mainly plywood and block boards registered a 9.2 per cent growth in 2015. Production of paper and paper products increased marginally by 0.4 per cent. Manufacture of toilet paper and exercise books went up by 2.3 per cent and 1.7 per cent, respectively. However, production of corrugated cartons went down by 3.7 per cent during the review period. In the same year, printing and production of recorded media decreased by 0.1 per cent. 11.20. Output of chemical and chemical products grew by 2.1 per cent in 2015 while industrial spirits and industrial gases increased by 17.9 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively. Manufacture of paints went up by 6.2 per cent from 47.8 million litres in 2014 to 50.7 million litres in 2015.

This is attributed to a decline of 9.7 per cent in the production of corrugated iron sheets from 284.5 thousand tonnes in 2014 to 256.9 thousand tonnes in 2015. The continued drop is partly linked to imports, which increased by 27.9 per cent to 1.5 million tonnes and the introduction of new roofing materials such as stone coated steel roofing sheets, and asphalt shingles in the market. On the other hand, manufacture of iron bar, rods and angles decelerated by 4.3 per cent during the review period. 11.24. Manufacture of fabricated metal products went down by 9.5 per cent in 2015 partly due to the decline in production of steel structures, which went down by 7.1 per cent.

The overall upstream inflation as measured by Producer Price Index (PPI) increased by 3.9 per cent from 109.17 in 2014 to 113.43 in 2015, as shown in Table 11.9. The increase was mainly due to high cost of imported raw materials arising from the depreciation of the Kenya Shilling against other major currencies. Industries that contributed to the increase were manufacture of textiles, manufacture of furniture, manufacture of food products and manufacture of beverages. However, manufacture of lubricating petroleum oils and lower costs of electricity helped in easing the industrial inflation. The increase in excise tax on beer, mineral water and soft drinks was increased in December 2015, caused the PPI of beverages to rise. The PPI for manufacture of food products increased mainly due to high prices of tea recorded in 2015 compared to the previous year. Developments 11.41. In 2015, the Government through the Ministry of Industry, Investment and Trade initiated programmes aimed at improving the output of the manufacturing sector and developing a favourable environment to shift into production of higher value-added goods that will be competitive in the export market. The plan aims to tap into new markets in textile and apparel, leather, food processing, fish processing and agro-processing sectors by establishing industrial parks, clusters, hubs and zones in different parts of the country. 11.42. Further, to simplify both local and foreign investment, Special Economic Zones Act, 2015, was enacted in December 2015, to provide for the establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs).

The overall upstream inflation as measured by Producer Price Index (PPI) increased by 3.9 per cent from 109.17 in 2014 to 113.43 in 2015, as shown in Table 11.9. The increase was mainly due to high cost of imported raw materials arising from the depreciation of the Kenya Shilling against other major currencies. Industries that contributed to the increase were manufacture of textiles, manufacture of furniture, manufacture of food products and manufacture of beverages. However, manufacture of lubricating petroleum oils and lower costs of electricity helped in easing the industrial inflation. The increase in excise tax on beer, mineral water and soft drinks was increased in December 2015, caused the PPI of beverages to rise. The PPI for manufacture of food products increased mainly due to high prices of tea recorded in 2015 compared to the previous year. Developments 11.41. In 2015, the Government through the Ministry of Industry, Investment and Trade initiated programmes aimed at improving the output of the manufacturing sector and developing a favourable environment to shift into production of higher value-added goods that will be competitive in the export market. The plan aims to tap into new markets in textile and apparel, leather, food processing, fish processing and agro-processing sectors by establishing industrial parks, clusters, hubs and zones in different parts of the country. 11.42. Further, to simplify both local and foreign investment, Special Economic Zones Act, 2015, was enacted in December 2015, to provide for the establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). The Government also introduced tamper proof tax stamps to enhance the fight against counterfeit products in the market. 197"

Total expenditure for the State Department of Infrastructure is expected to rise by 54.5 per cent to KSh 124.5 billion in 2015/16 compared to KSh 80.6 billion in 2014/15. This increase is mainly attributed to increased budgetary allocations towards development expenditure on roads for the financial year 2015/16, which is expected to rise from an expenditure of KSh 54.8 billion in 2014/15 to KSh 98.3 billion. Disbursements to various road agencies by the Kenya Roads Board (KRB) for maintenance and repair of roads is expected to increase from KSh 25.8 billion allocated in 2014/15 to KSh 26.2 billion in 2015/16. 12.3.

Although the approved expenditure in 2014/15 was KSh 7.4 billion, the amount actually spent was KSh 5.9 billion. The National Housing Corporation (NHC), which is the public agency responsible for real estate development, completed 45 housing units in Nyeri at a cost of KSh 61.5 million in 2015. In addition, NHC advanced housing loans amounting to KSh 14.9 billion to the Counties. The value of reported building plans approved went up from KSh 205.4 billion in 2014 to KSh 215.2 billion in 2015, representing an increase of 4.8 per cent. The value of reported new buildings completed in Nairobi increased by 15.1 per cent to stand at KSh 68.6 billion in 2015.

Wages in the Building and Construction sector rose by 10.0 per cent in 2015 from a 7.9 per cent growth in 2014 due to successful Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs) reached between unions in the sector and the employers. The rate of change of the total cost index of residential buildings and other construction went up by 4.4 per cent and 5.6 per cent, respectively, in 2015. Overall, total cost index increased by 4.9 per cent in 2015 compared to an increase of 10.1 per cent in 2014. The decline in the index is mainly attributable to the fall in fuel prices, a key component of the index. The year witnessed a steady decline in the prices of industrial diesel, automobile diesel fuel and petrol. However, other material inputs to the compilation of the index such as timber, hydrated lime, explosives, hard-core filling, aggregates and structural steel, recorded increases in prices during the review period.

The Kenya Utalii College (KUC) is one of Africa’s leading hospitality and training institutions whose graduates serve locally and internationally. The total number of graduates who pursued various courses at KUC declined from 2,350 in 2014 to 2,324 in 2015 as shown in Table 13.12. This was mainly attributed to the decrease in the number of people pursuing refresher courses. The number of graduates in short courses rose by 26.0 per cent in 2015 mainly as a result of increase in enrolments in food and beverage service basic course, food production and front office courses.

In 2015/16, the Government increased budgetary allocation to the State Department of T ourism from KSh 5.6 billion to KSh 10.7 billion, to among others, market Kenya as a preferred tourism destination. This was to counter the negative publicity occasioned by restrictive travel advisories in our key source markets. In addition, the Government created a stand-alone Ministry of T ourism, which is intended to focus more on issues that directly affect the sector. 13.23. The sector is expected to improve following the scrapping of landing fees at Mombasa and Malindi international airports for chartered planes from January 2016 till June 2018 and a subsidy of US$ 30 for each passenger who disembarks in Kenya during the period.Conference To u r i s m T raining Developments in the T ourism Sector"

Overall, the number of newly registered motor vehicles maintained an upward trend during the review period except for saloon cars which declined by 9.6 per cent to 14,369. Similarly, registration of other vehicles declined marginally from 2,533 in 2014 to 2,522 in 2015. The number of station wagons registered in 2015 rose slightly by 1.1 per cent to 54,120 units compared to a growth of 10.0 per cent in 2014. However, there are significantly higher number of registrations of station wagons in 2015 compared to 2011 as shown in Figure 14.1. 14.11. Lorries/Trucks: There has been a significant increase in the annual number of new registrations over the last five years as shown in Figure 14.1. During the review period, new registration of lorries and heavy trucks, panel vans and pick-ups; and buses and coaches rose by 29.1, 10.4 and 6.0 per cent respectively. The notable rise in registration of lorries and trucks could be attributed to increased construction activities. The number of trailers registered went up by 33.5 per cent from 2,925 in 2014 to 3,905 in 2015. 14.12. Motor cycles: Total motor cycles registered rose by 20.8 per cent to 139,420 in 2015 which is reflected by a 22.8 per cent growth in imports of motorcycles. The number of motor and auto cycles registered increased from 111,124 in 2014 to 134,645 in 2015, reflecting a growth of 21.2 per cent. The increase may be partly due to the rising demand for motor cycles as an alternative mode of passenger transport. Likewise, the number of three wheelers rose by 10.4 per cent during the review period.

Likewise, revenue earned from freight transport increased from KSh 6.1 billion in 2014 to KSh 6.2 billion during the review period. There has been a continuous decline in rail passenger indicators of journey, passenger-km and revenue. The major reason is prioritizing on the freight, which is more profitable than passengers’ services hence the available locomotives are prioritized to freight. Passenger journeys declined to 2,359 thousand in 2015 compared to 3,845 thousand in 2014. This led to a 38.9 per cent drop in earnings from passenger traffic stream in 2015.

Passenger traffic: Details of commercial traffic handled at the airports for the period Transport 2011 to 2015 are shown in Table 14.10(a). During the review period, total passenger traffic handled recorded a slow growth of 1.3 per cent compared to 7.9 per cent in the previous year. This is partly attributed to a decline of 3.0 per cent in the number of international passengers handled in 2015. The total number of passengers handled stood at 8,993.2 thousand in 2015 up from 8,882.0 thousand in 2014. While total domestic passengers handled rose by 9.0 per cent to 3.4 million in 2015, total international passengers handled contracted by 3.0 per cent from 5.7 million in 2014 to 5.6 million in the year under review. This decline is partly due to negative travel advisories by some key tourist source countries especially during the first half of 2015 that impacted negatively on tourist arrivals. Total passengers handled at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) stood at 6.5 million passengers in 2015 up from 6.4 million passengers recorded in 2014. Domestic and international passengers handled at Moi International Airport (MIA) were 902,600 and 329,400 respectively, during the review period. 14.22. Cargo and Mail Traffic: Table 14.10(b) shows the commercial cargo and mail traffic by airport from 2011 to 2015. During the reference period, total cargo traffic handled at the airports decreased by 5.9 per cent from 279.4 thousand in 2014 to 263.0 thousand. Total mail traffic handled at both JKIA and MIA increased 15.6 per cent in 2015. 228",

Over the years, increased deployment of fiber optic cables, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave (WIMAX) and Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) technologies have seen a steady growth of the internet and broadband market, which have resulted in improved competitive data services to consumers. Further, the Government has continued to focus on the implementation of e-government to enhance the uptake of ICT in its operations for effective and efficient delivery of services to its citizens. The sustained uptake of ICTs in the country is expected to continue supporting economic growth and modernization as well as enabling optimization of production in every sector of the economy. In 2015, the country successfully concluded the digital migration for TV broadcasting ahead of the global deadline of 17th June 2015.

However, the growth remained robust because of resilient expansion in mobile telephony networks and increased uptake of internet services. The freeing up of valuable portions of the TV broadcast spectrum that emanated from the successful completion of the digital migration facilitated significant growth of digital TV stations from 36 in 2014 to 62 in 2015. This has benefited the consumers through more options, better sound and picture quality. In 2015, mobile telephony continued to revolutionize the uptake of ICT services, in particular, the mobile broadband and mobile money services. Consequently, mobile telephone subscriptions increased leading to a rise in penetration from 78.3 per cent in 2014 to 85.4 per cent in 2015. Internet subscriptions increased significantly from 16.4 million in 2014 to 23.9 million in 2015. This resulted in increased internet and broadband penetration from 38.3 per cent and 9.9 per cent in 2014 to 54.2 per cent and 16.4 per cent in 2015, respectively. Similarly, data speed for computer modems and transmission carriers increased by 66.9 per cent to 20,293 bits per second per capita (BPs/person) owing to availability of fiber optic. However, the mobile telephone capacity decreased by 3.5 per cent due to the exit of Essar Kenya (YU) limited from the Kenyan market. The fixed network capacity declined sharply due to the decommissioning of fixed wireless in 2015, which resulted in a reduction of its penetration from 0.52 per cent in 2014 to 0.19 per cent.

The value of ICT output increased by 8.1 per cent to stand at KSh 280.0 million in 2015 compared to KSh 259.0 million in 2014. Intermediate consumption increased by 14.9 per cent. As a result value added decreased from KSh 66.3 in 2014 to KSh 58.7 in 2015, representing 11.4 per cent drop. 232",

Fixed Telephone: The performance of fixed and mobile network services is shown in Telephone Table 15.2. During the year under review, Telkom Kenya decommissioned the fixed wireless and Mobile network due to the obsolete technology, expensive maintenance cost and high competition Network from other telephone technologies. Consequently, subscribers under Code Division Multiple Services Access (CDMA) network were migrated to the company’s mobile network. This resulted in a decline of fixed wireline capacity from 340 thousand in 2014 to 75 thousand in 2015. However, the wireline connections, increased by 77.1 per cent from 48 thousand in 2014 to 85 thousand in 2015. 15.5. Mobile Network Services: In 2015, the mobile telephone capacity declined by 3.5 per cent to 62.8 million owing to the exit of Essar Kenya (YU) limited. Airtel Kenya and Safaricom took over subscribers and infrastructure from the exiting operator, respectively. However, Equitel, which is a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) on Airtel infrastructure, entered the market during the same year. This led to an increase of 12.1 per cent mobile connections to stand at 37.7 million subscribers in 2015. The growth in the subscribers resulted in an expansion in used mobile capacity from 51.7 per cent in 2014 to 60.1 per cent in 2015.In the mobile money sector, the number of agents increased by 16.4 per cent from 123,703 in 2014 to 143,946 in 2015. Similarly, the number of mobile money transfer service subscribers grew by 2.8 per cent to 26.8 million over the same period.

International Telephone Traffic: Voice call traffic for the period 2011 to 2015 is traffic presented in Table 15.3. The international telephone traffic increased by 11.4 per cent from 1,053 million minutes in 2014 to 1,173 million minutes in 2015. This was a reversal from the declines that had been recorded since 2013. The outgoing and incoming international telephone traffic increased by 17.9 per cent and 6.3 per cent, respectively, in 2015 as shown in Figure 15.1. However, fixed line traffic has been declining since 2012 as shown in Figure 15.2. The increase in the international mobile traffic was partly due to the reduction of international mobile rates within the East African Community, except Tanzania, through the One Network Area Initiative that enhanced the standardization of the calling rates. The decline in fixed line traffic may be attributed to the decommissioning of the fixed wireless network during the review period. 15.7. Roaming Traffic: Total roaming traffic more than doubled to 194.8 million minutes in 2015. Similarly, both outbound and inbound roaming more than doubled to 91.2 and 103.6 million minutes, respectively, during the review period. The increase in roaming traffic may partly be attributed to the reduced calling rates within the East African Community (EAC) and the visits by high-level dignitaries during the review period. 15.8. Domestic Traffic: The total domestic telephone call traffic increased by 27.7 per cent from 30.7 billion minutes in 2014 to 39.2 billion minutes in 2015.

Mobile to fixed telephone traffic increased by 13.3 per cent to 75.4 million minutes. However, fixed to fixed telephone traffic registered a drastic decline from 23.3 million minutes in 2014 to 5.3 million minutes in 2015 mainly attributed to the decommissioning of the fixed wireless network. 15.9. VoIP Traffic: The volume of the international outgoing fixed Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) traffic declined by 34.8 per cent to 4.8 million minutes in 2015. The VoIP traffic has been declining since 2011 mainly due to shift in preference to instant messaging applications and social media. 234",

The improvement in the uptake of ICT was partly attributed to the affordability of mobile phones in the market; cheaper internet bundles offered by mobile operators and finalization of phase one of laying the fiber optic cables across the country. The internet penetration stood at 54.2 per cent in 2015 with that of wireless internet increasing to 53.9 per cent. Total broadband penetration increased to 16.4 per cent in 2015 from 9.9 per cent in 2014. The bits per second per capita (Bps/person) increased by 66.9 per cent to 20,293.0 in 2015. The mobile money penetration remained unchanged in the period under review. 15.21. ICT Penetration Rate (3 years and above): This measures the ICT penetration for the population aged three years and above which is considered capable of owning and using ICT equipment. The mobile penetration stood at 94.0 per cent while internet penetration stood at 59.6 per cent in 2015. Broadband subscriptions increased to 18.1 per cent in 2015 from 10.9 per cent in 2014. 241",

The 2006, baseline survey and the subsequent surveys of 2009 and 2013, have shown that Kenya has made significant progress in fostering financial inclusion, with the latest survey providing a ten year perspective on Kenya’s financial landscape. The 2015FinAccess Household Survey was jointly conducted by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) and Financial Sector Deepening Kenya (FSD Kenya) between August and October 2015. The findings from the survey showed that Kenya has made significant progress in fostering financial inclusion over the past decade. Following the growth in access and usage of financial services across the financial sector, Kenya’s progress in formal financial inclusion has made it a leader across the continent, after South Africa, but considerably above countries in the East African Community (EAC) region.

The overall objective of the FinAccess survey is to measure and provide better of the understanding of the financial inclusion landscape in Kenya and monitor progress overtime survey under the Kenya Vision 2030 Medium Term Plan (MTP) targets for the financial sector. The specific objectives of the survey were to: provide information to policymakers about the main barriers to financial inclusion; provide information to the private sector about market opportunities in the financial sector; track progress and evaluate the effect of various government and donor led initiatives in the financial sector; and provide data for use in research into the impact of enhanced financial inclusion and innovations on growth and poverty reduction.

As indicated in Figure 17.3, the survey revealed that formal inclusion for men has risen strand by steadily from 33.2 per cent in 2006 to 79.7 per cent in 2015, whereas for women, it has risen gender, from 20.5 per cent in 2006 to 71.2 per cent in 2015. This has mainly been driven by the spread age, and of Mobile Financial Services (MFSs) whereby the usage by men and women was 75.5 per education cent and 67.5 per cent, respectively. Ultimately, this has lessened women’s previous exclusive reliance on the use of informal financial services providers. However, women still have lower access to formal prudentially regulated service providers compared to men, such as, banks (46.8 per cent for men and 30.6 per cent for women) and insurance (29.8 per cent for men and 17.0 per cent for women). Reliance on groups is far more common among women (51.4 per cent) compared to men (30.9 per cent). Figure 17.3: Access strand by gender between 2006 and 2015 17.9. The survey findings show that age plays an important role in financial inclusion. The oldest and youngest age groups (below 25 and above 55 years) are more likely to be excluded and less likely to have formal financial services than the middle band of the population (Figure 17.4). The survey revealed that 23.1 per cent of young adults aged 18 to 25 years are excluded compared to the national average of 17.4 per cent. Exclusion for the elderly population above 55 years is even higher at 28.4 per cent. Younger adults had higher adoption rates for MFSs and mobile banking technologies. Further, over 23 per cent of people aged 18 to 25 were actively using a mobile banking account against less than 4 per cent of the population above 55 years. 273",

As indicated in Figure 17.3, the survey revealed that formal inclusion for men has risen strand by steadily from 33.2 per cent in 2006 to 79.7 per cent in 2015, whereas for women, it has risen gender, from 20.5 per cent in 2006 to 71.2 per cent in 2015. This has mainly been driven by the spread age, and of Mobile Financial Services (MFSs) whereby the usage by men and women was 75.5 per education cent and 67.5 per cent, respectively. Ultimately, this has lessened women’s previous exclusive reliance on the use of informal financial services providers. However, women still have lower access to formal prudentially regulated service providers compared to men, such as, banks (46.8 per cent for men and 30.6 per cent for women) and insurance (29.8 per cent for men and 17.0 per cent for women). Reliance on groups is far more common among women (51.4 per cent) compared to men (30.9 per cent). Figure 17.3: Access strand by gender between 2006 and 2015 17.9.
